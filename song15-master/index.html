                    <h4>Q: Where do my old Song15’s go?</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">A: Most likely you have received more than 15 Song15’s, and when you go over 15; the oldest Song15 gets deleted, to give you a maximum of 15. That was a mouthful. Keep in mind, that each friend page is allowed 15 Song15’s also. Basically, we love the number 15 so when you receive a lot … make sure you listen fast. </p>
        
                    <hr class="lig">
                    <h4>Q: Why does the app need access to my contacts?</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">A: You can only see the Song15’s you and a friend have sent each other by tapping their name on the home page. Here is a scenario:<br /><br>

                    For example Don and Walter are friends. Don sends a Song15 to Walter and it appears on Walter’s home page. Walter does not receive another Song15 from Don in a week and Don’s name disappears from Walter’s home page. <br >
                    There are two things Walter can do here<br /><br>
                    a.  Send Don a Song15, or more than one, until Don replies back with a Song15 of his own (which, in effect, will show Don’s name on Walter’s home page and Don’s name can be tapped to open his friend page).<br/>
                    b.  Wait to see Don at school and tell Don to send him a Song15 in a funny, but maybe awkward way.

                    Note: The first option seems better, but do whatever floats your boat.
                     </p>

                    <hr class="lig">
                    <h4>Q: How do I hide/show the Song15 overlay icon?</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">A: Tapping on the 15 logo located at the footer of the app home page. </p>
