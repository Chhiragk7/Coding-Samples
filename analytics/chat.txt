How may I help you today?    I'm happy to take a look into your bill for you to see what might be causing these changes. Please allow me a few moments to review your account.  Thank you for your patience. Just to give you an update, I'm still here looking over your bill history to see what I can discover.  I appreciate your continued patience with me, Robin. Upon review of your billing history, I see that you're on the More Everything 10GB plan with a $100.00 access charge, and that you have three smartphones which have $40.00 line access charges each. I understand that saving money is important, and I've taken a look at your average data usage which is actually around 6GB.  Based on this information, would you be interested in moving down in a data allowance in order to save some money?  I completely understand. Let me take another look and check a few more things for you.  Great news! I have a promotional offer that we can apply to your account today of 10GB for $80.00 instead of the $100.00. How does this sound?  Wonderful. I'll go ahead and apply that plan change for you.  Not a problem! You can expect a savings of $20.00 to your total bill each month because of the plan change.   Just to give you an update, I've successfully applied the plan change to your account.  You're so welcome!   Do you have any further questions or concerns I may assist you with?  Not a problem! It's been a pleasure speaking with you today, Robin, and I'd like to thank you for being a loyal Verizon customer since 2006! Again, my name is Gabrielle, and when you're ready to say goodbye to me please click on the END CHAT button in your chat window. Thank you for your business with us here at Verizon and have a great day!||@I am confused about why my verizon bill seems to be increasing over the past several months when I have not made any changes.  We dropped a line a few months ago but that is the only change I recall.  that's fine.  ok  Yes, I think I would.  I believe this last month I used almost all 10 GB though.  That would help a great deal.  Thanks  So how much should I expect each line to be per month if we don't go over at all?  Thank you.  no I'm all set.  Thanks||@

Good Wednesday evening!  I'll be glad to look at that with you tonight! May I please ask who I'm chatting with?  Hi, Byron! Give me just a moment while I get that open and I'll go over that with you.  I see. Thanks for that info, Byron. I'm going over your bill now.  I do see you changed plans recently.  I see on page 2 of your latest bill a ""20% Access Discount"" being applied to your new plan. Since the cost of that MORE Everything 3GB plan is $50.00, with a 20% discount that would come out to $40.00, which is reflected there.  Are you still chatting with me, Byron?  Great!  Oh my, thanks for pointing that out, Byron. I see that now as well.  I'm looking deeper into this for you.  Thanks for your patience while I get to the bottom of this.  So, I'll go line by line. You have a $30.00 credit for your previous plan.  Next is the $50.00 charge for the period of 07/07 - 08/06. This puts us at $20.00.  Then is the $10.00 credit for your discount. So $10.00 is our running total.  Then you have the $50.00 charge for the month in advance, that is the period for 08/07 - 09/06. Now our running total is $60.00.  Yes, that's exactly right, Byron.  Indeed, that's correct, Byron.  What else can I help you with tonight?||@i need my bill double checked i think it didnt take my discount  byron  instead of 50 my data should be 40  yes  yes im here  it say 50 - 10 for discount but total is still 50  no problem  ok  ok  ok  then 60 -10 50 got it  so next month it should be about 1o dollars less right  ok thank you  thats all||@

Thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless. I hope you are having a Wonderful Wednesday.  Yes, this is an option. Allow me a moment to review your account.  May I have your name please?   Nice to meet you, Kevin! Did you want to upgrade now, or at a later time?  I completely understand, it is good to plan ahead :-)  You would upgrade that line normally, and place the device on the smartphone. Since the contract date can not exceed two years, it can not be extended for the other number.  That is correct.   Yes, that is correct too. However, the MORE Everything will stop being offered today, so I would suggest switching over if you are considering it. I can go over the charges with you if you would like?  I have not heard from you for a few moments.  Would you like me to keep this chat session open for you?||@I have a question about transferring a upgrade  is it possible to transfer an upgrade from a basic phone line to a smart phone line?  kevin sarnowski  just looking for information, so at a later time most likely  what is the ramifications of transferring a basic phone line upgrade to a smart phone line?  that would force that line to carry a dataplan from that point forward correct?  thanks for the clarification. one more question, if I moved phones that are currently under contract into the more everything plan the monthly access fee for those phones are $40, once their contracts end would they discount to $15 a month?  if 6 gb or more is carried???  I'm good thanks for your help||@

You are on a more everything plan with  10gb of data.  You can add up to 10 lines on this plan at anytime.   I understand you can still add other lines to your existing plan.   When you switch  a device you do not get a new contract that line would pay $15 a month rather than $40 a month to share the plan. That line will be saving $25 a month.   I am sorry the screen froze. That is correct if you want to buy him a new phone  then he would get the $200. I have checked on the $100 port and he can get that credit if he keeps his current device.  Sure  Yes what you would do is a device swap. You would activate his device to your number and he would activate your device to his number.   No there are not any activating fees for swapping phones between two lines. This can be done easlily from your online account once both lines are showing on the account. You would place your mouse over My Verizon at the top of your account.  Then hover it over My Device.  From there select activate and switch device.   From there you would see the option to swap phones between two existing lines.  You are welcome thanks for joining our services.    Before we part ways, have we addressed all of your needs to ensure exceptional service with Verizon?  ?Thank you for chatting with me today and being a valued Verizon customer.   You can also find us on Twitter at @VZWSupport.  Please click on the ??End Chat?? button to end this chat.?||@Can I add a phone to my existing plan at any time?  My son's phone is with T-Mobile and I am waiting for it to be unlocked.  I read that you are changing plans tomorrow and wanted to ensure I could still add his phone once it is unlocked.  Great, that will simplify the switch.  Are there any special deals for switching an existing number and keeping you existing phone?  Great.  If I buy a new phone your current special offers $100 credit for porting number and $200 for a smart phone trade in.  Did not know if the $100 credit would apply if you had your own device.  Still there??  One more question -  Is it possible to swap numbers between two phones on the same account?  Are there any activation fees associated with the swap.  Considering a trade up once the new iphones are available but would need to swap numbers.  Great.  Thank you for answering my questions.  Yes.||@

Yes I do see that I'm sorry that you where disconnected. I can finish up for you I will not be able to reconnect you to im. But I am sure he has remarked all changes that would take place in your account.  Yes that is what I am doing now.  Thank you for your patience I have reviewed your note's I will have to review the chat session to see what the offer was it is not remarked here. Just a moment please.  Yes I am in the discounts page of your account now looking for your discount's.  Yes I will most certainly let you know of any other discount's.  I have found your discount's the first is for 10% off thew line access no your line 6657 and the other is to receive 50% off the line access on that line correct?  The * and  on *  Second line.  Okay great! I will add that for you now. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  Yes this will be monthly the requirement for this discount to be applied is Contract will be extended 1-year from day offer is provisioned. so they will expire on 08/12/2015 your 6657 line will end on 12/14/2016 and the other has ended already so this will be great to add to save you money you will not even see the change's before you are able to upgrade.  Did the last rep advise you of this before offering to add this to your account?  This is free to you. please let me explain again before you end the chat.  Yes your contract does not end until 12/14/2016 the contract extension will start today the day it is applied. so it will end on 08/12/2016 you will not even notice it was extended because your 2yr will not be over with yet.  And for the other line you will only be paying $5 dollar's with the 50% off and it is not within contract.  I am not sure why you think you will pay more you will not be in contract longer then what you are now., I do not understand what you mean you will be saving.  Yes. I also stated ( extended 1-year from day offer is provisioned.)08/12/2015  so this time next yr you will be in contract still because your current contract will not end until 12/14/2016 this is way after the discount as expired. You will not even see an extension.   A year from today is 08/12/2016  your contract does not end until after that date 12/14/2016 you will not see an extension.  We are adding it but it will start today ending a yr from now which is great for you because your line does not end until after the date.  Contract will be extended 1-year from day offer is provisioned. ( that is today) It is not replacing your current contract It would have extended it if your date did not fall as it did after the date of it being applied.This is why this is a great option for you most people wit until they are almost out of contract so usually it is extended in your case it will not be.  I will get total's for you now. Please allow me a moment to add your bill's.  No problem at all.  Thank you for your patience I am getting all total's for you.  Thank you.  Yes I understand completely. I am adding your total's a fast as possible but I would like all information to be correct for you. for now billing with discount and without.  With your discount's applied your bill amount will be 167 and after it has expired you will be saving more with your month to moth discount this will bring your line's to about $135 after taxes.  month*  Okay no problem.  Your all set Hoon. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  Let me check for you.okay.  Currently you do not have a promotion for data but you can always check back next week as this can change daily.  .

I DONT WANT THIS DISCOUNT***  is this how you treat your loyal customer?  is this how your team is finding discounts for the customers?  ok... you said you will give me discount if I add another year to the contract right?  Kimiko: Yes this will be monthly the requirement for this discount to be applied is Contract will be extended 1-year from day offer is provisioned.  that is what you wrote here.  EXTEND ANOTHER YEAR  so you are not adding 1 year extension to the 2 year I have  so is the 1 year extension replacing the 2 year or its withing the 2 year? can you have double extension?  so in plain numbers, I have 4 devices.. what am I paying now per device, what will be during YEAR, what will be after YEAR.  thanks,  waiting...  been here for last hour  take your time...  great.. then lets apply to it :)  nope, unless you can add more data to my current plan without extending anything...hahaha  thank you...  have a gnight.||@

Thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless Chat. My name is Jenn, How may I help you today?   Wow Arnie! Thank you for taking time out of your day to bring this up, I can help you get that secure! Which line will we be working with? Line ending in 7295?  Ok, on the LG G2, go ahead and open the Mobile Hotspot application.  Up at the top there's your on/off button along with a magnifying glass. You'll have three options underneath. We need to go into ""Set Up""  Ok, go ahead and go to your main home screen, you will select the big circle with six dots inside on the bottom right hand corner. All applications will come up, We are looking for one that says ""Mobile Hotspot"". It's a red square with a white antenna inside of it. Select that icon please.  Do you see that first option of ""Set Up""?  When you select it, a pop up will come up. Seems to be the 4th option where it says ""Password (security key)""  There you can put your own password.  This will be the password that your other devices will ask for to be able to connect to your hotspot  The password makes it secure. If they don't know your password, they can't use your hotspot.  What do you usually use your hotspot with Arnie?  So now when you try to connect your laptop with your hotspot the laptop will ask you for the password, then it will connect||@Hi Jenn  I went to use my hot spot and it is no longer password protected and it looks like anyone can grab onto my phone's signal.  Is there a way to put a password on it so only I can use it?  yes  it is open  So on the top it says Wireless & Networks with the magnifying glass.  under that it says tethering and connect other device...  there I have Mobile Broadband, Mobile Hotspot and Bluetooth .  I don't see any set up  Hi  Found it  yes  OK  I see that, how do I make the connection secure?  Right now anyone can use my hotspot  My laptop  I will try it again but it didn't ask for a password when I tried before I contacted you.  I will try again right now and see if it asks for one.  thanks  If I have any other issues I will let you know  Thank you||@

I am having issues with my account that I was hoping to figure out.  My plan that I currently have now has 2 GB of data and for the last few months I have gone over it so the first month that I did I had called and spoken to someone who was supposed to change it but said that it wouldn't go into place until the next billing cycle but there is still nothing and I am still going over and paying over an extra 30$ a month.  Thank you for your help. I have never had any issues before!  I am currently online looking at my plan and it was actually 1 Gb and was supposed to be changed to the 2 GB and i do see an option to do that now even though it was already supposed to be done 2 months ago. Not sure what the mixup was  Thank you very much. It would have been the first month I went over which I believe was 3 billing cycles ago when I had called.||@

When the new plans roll out, current agreements and contracts will stay and completed as usually.  usual*  You will continue to get the discount until the device is paid off.  If you choose one of the new data plan options EDGE phones will have the $20.00 line access and phones on a current 2yr will have a $40.00 line access until the terms are completed at which point the line for this phone will drop to $20.00  Staying in you current MORE plan and choosing not to upgrade phones will allow you to retain the $25.00 line access discount and when the other contract phone is done it will get a $25.00 discount also. In the long tun the line access for both phones is $15.00 each.  Do you have any further questions or concerns I may assist you with?    Thank you for chatting with me!

Lets get the restriction rolling.  Let me just quickly pull up your account.   Ok on your phone go into settings.   select cellular  and where the green button next to cellular data is turn it off.  Awesome! another suggestion that I personally use is the Family Base helps limit and restrict the data. Would you like to learn more?  Yes absolutely! It is just moving the settings on the device as we did. In the event you would like to grant the kiddos some access family base would be perfect.   Family base has an additional cost of $4.99. It is not a requirement I just thought since it has been good for me I should share the wealth of knowledge.   If you like to just disable the data on their phones it would be just as we switched on the phone now.  Great question! It would be in settings, cellular then turn off cellular data.   To only use via wifi turn on wifi and process the connection with the provider.   Yes, you are correct. I agree with you, I remember my teenage years. How about I send you the information. The first month is on us, in the event you like to subscribe to it.   I understand your concern I have a pre-teen myself and I know how convenient it is to save money and not have to worry about overages.   Let me run an analysis on your account on how I can save you money and if you decide to subscribe for the service, ok.  Thanks for the opportunity. Just a few seconds.   Found a great option. On lines ending in 6186 and 3997 I can attach a 10% monthly saving off of the $40.00 charge by taking advantage of the promotion it will help offset the charge for family base.  This would be good for 12 months. How about it?  It would not affect you current contract dates, they would stay the same. The plan for data allowance is 3GB shared family base restrictions start off at 500mb.   You can also set time restrictions and trusted numbers.   Great question! Your 3 month average is 1.3GB  Awesome! I will give you an additional 500mb for the next 12 months. It will work trust me I love family base. I will send you an email with the step instructions to set up the restrictions.  Oh wow! My mom is a heavy user, shes learned the hard way that family base dominates over her usage. shes learned to manage using wifi when it becomes available.   I bet. But rest assured as long as the set up is done with stop all usage when limit is reached there won't be a way for them to exceed.   All we need to do is set up the restrictions on all lines to sum up to 3.5 and you will be good.   May I have your email address so I may send the instructions to set the limits.  Ok, I sent it out. Read over it and the guide to set up is very detailed and easy to follow.  I have attached the discounts of 10%  on lines 6186 and 3997  and the bonus data of 500 mb on the account.   Any other concerns for me today?  Sounds great! Thanks for the opportunity.  Once again my name is Christy. It has been a pleasure assisting you today.

If you purchase 2 Droid Turbo on the Device Payment Agreement and bring your device with you and have the More Everything plan with unlimited talk and text and 10GB of data for all lines to share your monthly bill will be $165 before taxes or added features for 24 months.  do you have the phone for him or would you need to purchase a new one.  ?  Yes that is correct and the monthly payments of the new phones added to that.  Yes  there is no interest on the phones.  Say you purchase 4 Droid Turbos on the Device Payment Agreement and have the More Everything plan with unlimited talk and text and 10GB of data for all lines to share the monthly bill will be $220 before taxes for 24 months.  After the phones are paid off the monthly bill will drop to $140 before taxes  As a sales agent I do not have the capability to figure taxes. Each city and state are different.  The only information that we have been given on the changes is what is on the website. We can not confirm the pricing of all the changes at this time  I will be happy to send you the link to the information on the changes if you would like?  No  I would purchase tonight to get the $25 line access fee credit for each line on the Device Payment Agreement.  Yes you do qualify for the $300 credit.  If you bring your numbers with you from Sprint you will receive a $100 credit for each number you port over  And if you trade in the current phones from Sprint and get new ones on the Device Payment Agreement you will receive a $200 gift card for each phone you trade in.  No problem  I will send you a link to the Droid Turbo to get the order process started  click here for Droid Turbo  If  you will click the above link  Those were a limited edition. They are no longer available. I am sorry.  The Ballistic Nylon is water resistant  If you will click on the Droid Turbo  Choose quantity  Click Device Payment  click add to cart  Choose existing customer   Customize  On the confirm pricing page click continue  The next page is the device protection page  You will choose the insurance or decline and click continue  On the features page you can click continue those are optional and can be added at anytime  We have a great deal on build a bundle deal. This includes one of the best cases on the market! An Otterbox case for $50 to $60, screen protector, and a car charger. A savings of up to $35!  You will choose any otterbox for $50 or $60 and any screen protectors and any car charger and in the CART page you will see the $35 credit for bundling them together  Why do you say that?  At the CART page click checkout.  Okay no problem  Okay click checkout  The first screen is the personal information page.  You will enter  your personal information  Yes once you receive the new phones you will call into customer service to activate them and request the return package to trade in your current phones. Once they receive the phones they will issue you a credit on the bill or send you the gift card for each phone.  And once you port over the numbers from Sprint you will receive a $100 credit for each number you port over within 2-3 billing cycles  Yes do you have a work email address?  Okay give me a moment to look it up. you can continue with the checkout process while I look this up for you  it is my pleasure  You will receive a 20% discount on your monthly bill.   Once you receive your phones and activate them call into customer service and have them apply your employer discount  very good discount  I will be more than happy to.  Just a couple of more clicks and the phones will be on their way!!!  Actually I would recommend just choosing new numbers tonight and that way your current phones will not be disconnected  And when you receive the new phones call in and have the numbers ported immediately.  Just seems to make it easier  One more click and the phones will be on the way  You need to click Submit or Complete Order  Just one more click. You have not gotten the confirmation number  You need to click Complete order or Submit Order  Yes you got it.  Is there anything else I can assist with tonight?  Thank you!! It has been a pleasure chatting with you!!  Thank you for becoming a valued Verizon Wireless customer! We really appreciate your business and it has been my pleasure assisting you today.  I hope I have helped you have an outstanding experience.||@Hi  Im Jim Stolz, A current Sprint Customer  I love the customer service and rate plans with Sprint, but we live in an area where they have poor coverage  I know your plans change tomorrow and I want to compare what you can offer today vs tomorrow  we have 3 lines (could be 4) we do not want a contract we need about 10 gig of data per month  I have one phone still on contract with Sprint  I know the 2 CDMA phones will not transfer over--- I have a google Play Nexus 5 that I would like to bring along is that possible?  I checked online and It says it is not but I have friends who were able to activate the Nexus on your network  we are leaning to the droid turbo  thanks  also I have a 25 year old son with autism and Down syndrome and we are considering adding him for the 4th line. Not sure what Android phone might be the best option  that is quite a bit more than we pay with Sprint  we need to purchase  I thought we got 10 gig for $80 and $15 per line>  Oh--- you have the phone fees included  I see  can you price me for replacing my Nexus and adding a cheaper phone for the 4th  Do you change interest on the phones--- are we better to just pay cash?  and can you compare what we would pay today vs what we would pay with the new pricing that takes effect tomorrow?  cool  Can you tell me taxes and fees?  and how that plan compares to the new plan that launches tomorrow  well stinkers--- if you were me would you wait until tomorrow?  do we also qualify for the $300 credit per line and waiver of activation fees?  but not for the new line correct?  ok let;s do this---- I;ve been with Sprint for 15 years-- I really hate to leave them  sorry for being hesitant  are there different Droid Turbos or al tjhe same  Got it---  I see an ad in our chat box for the Metallic Turbo  I do not see it on the site  O What is the difference between the Turbo and ballistic nylon?  Ahhh Ok 3 of those  got it  ok  whre do I see that?  very overwhelming  Lots of choices that dont interest me  I think I will add later  Im at the checkout screen  Do I qualify for a service discount?  I was asking about an employee discount are you able to look up my affilatations?  martythompson@iheartmedia.com  or martythompson@clearchannel.com  yes I;m working on it thanks  sweet  can you stay with me while I comntinue to checkout?  HA--- Its been son long since Ive had to log into sprint I forgot my credintials  credintials  SP??  Oh Ok  all done ---thank you  we are all good--- i thnk  all good---thank you||@

Happy Wednesday :) !  Thank you Peter.  No problem , I can most certainly review and calculate to confirm for you .  Allow me one moment to access your account for one moment   Thank you for your patience '  How has your overall experience with Verizon been if you don't mind me asking ?  You are currently on the more everything plan with unlimited talk and text and 2gb for $40 and you have two smartphone lines out of contract and hey would receive an discount of $15 per line, making your line $25 per line so your bill would be $90 before taxes   It has been a few minutes since I have heard from you, I just want to make sure that you're still with me!  Yes I am \  Yes that is correct   No you have not as of yet , would you like to make this change ?  The discounts would be the same whether you are on 2gb or 3gb, it would only be more for 6gb ore more  or*  I am checking on an bonus data offer , I am not currently showing an extra 1gb'  It may have , I am checking to make sure for you :) .  No problem \  Thank you for your patience   As I review , I am seeing that the 1gb expired , I am seeing that you have an offer for 500mb to be added free fo\r 1 year   Most certainly :)   Yes it is .  Yes it has been , I just submitted it for you   What I would like to do is assist you with an link to get your account registered . That appears to be the issue , but no worries , we can get this corrected for you   Your line registered in my verizon that is :) .  I do apologize for any confusion  No problem , what I am referencing is getting your line set up for my verizon to be able to access it , may I ask was the line that was registered before set as the owner line ?  In my verizon ?  Yes sir   Thank you for confirming for me   Line 602-717-2676 is not registered for my verizon which is why you can not access it , line 4804157855 is set as the owner line   I will be happy to provide you with the link to change it   CLICK HERE   May I ask did the link work ok for you ?  Oh no ! I am sorry about your phone . Not to worry , you are able to finish this up an an later time as well if you'd like .  You would need the secure pin(registration)  to proceed which would allow you to be set as the ownde  owner  and the other line was unregistered as there can only be one account owner   No sir , he can most certainly get his owner ship back and add you as an manager   Yes not no  Through the same link I just provided you   May I ask did this work for your friend ?  Great and yes that is correct . Since you would be sent an pin to your phone   Your phone line is active  Yes sir   May I ask do you have any other questions or concerns for me this evening ?  It has been a few minutes since I have heard from you, I just want to make sure that you're still with me!  Since I have not heard from you in a while, I apologize but I must close this Chat Session. Please do not hesitate to contact us again by chatting back in or calling us at 1-800-922-0204 if you need further assistance. Thank you for being part of the Verizon Family!||@hello  you too  I would like to know the total price of what I'm paying after the discounts that I have.  My phone number is 602-717-2676  one seceond  are you still there?  So I'm paying total of $90 for both lines and 2 gb?  I thought I upgraded to 3 gb?  i thought i made this change because someone told me that I can get better discounts, is this true?  like instead of getting the $15 per line, I get more?  Also, don't I already get extra 1 gb, no?  i see  Do I still get that 1 gb extra?  It used to be 3 gb total because of a prmotion or something  i see  I wonder if it expired  thanks  ok, may I have that offer?  So it's $90 total for both lines, right?  okay, and did the promotion added by chance?  Also, I can't access much on my Verizon Wireless online website, is there a problem?  ok great  what do you mean account registered?  Don't I have an account already?  it's okay, but I'm still not clear  what account registration are you talking about?  Is it because I deactivated my line recently?  what do you mean before?  Before I became the owner?  602-717-2676  this is the number since the begining  beginning  ok  okay, how do i change this?  I think when I deactivated my line, I gave the ownership to my friend  ok  I'm trying it right now, but it's asking for the registration pin  and my phone isn't working currenlty  currently*  wait, so I can't do this until I have a phone?  also, I haven't finish this yet, but my friend just asked me if I unregistered his phone  what's registration pin?  oh man...  so right now none of us are owners...  is there any way that my friend get the owner ship again?  so his phone is not working...?  how  okay, how  we're working on it.  so I would need my phone working for sure to transfer it?  I've done this one the phone before though  so is my phone line still not active?  i see||@

Welcome to Verizon Wireless Live Chat! My name is Jenny and I'm from colorful Colorado ^_^.  How can I help you today?  Uh oh! I would be more than happy to help you get logged in! But first, may I have your full name and 10-digit phone number please so that I can look at your account?  Thanks :) Give me a couple minutes to pull up your account and I'll be right with you   ok, just to let you know when I pulled up your account, it did not list a biling password (with online chats I need to verify you by the billing pin before I can access your account) so I would have limited access. May I ask if you've tried entering in a zip code from a previous address?  gotcha. Ok, what you will need to do to get this resolved as soon as possible is to go into a local verizon store with photo id to create a new billing password  would you like me to look up the address of the nearest store for you?  with password resets, the way the system works is that it can only send a temporary password either by text message to the number listed on the account or by postal mail in a letter. (We are not able to send passwords by email)  and I would not have access to your account from my end to send the password, so at this point, your best option is to go in store   yes and I do apologize for the inconvenience, when they set up your account, due to being  an international student, they should have set you up with a billing password. Since its a live chat over the computer, I don't have access to make changes since I can't verify you on my end, but when you go in store with photo id, you can get a billing pin, as well as get that zip code||@Hi. When I created my account the printer at the SOHO Verizon was broken and they were supposed to email it to me. I'm trying to reset my password but the system doesn't recognize my zip code and I don't know which zip code they put in my contract.  Ana Verena Sarmento Nigro 9292750734  i don't have a previous address  Im an international student  and i wasn't given/emailed a contract so i can't see what's wrong  can't you reset the password? that way thell send an email to the account i have on file  send it by text then  that is not convenient at all and i shouldn't have to go out of my way because the person who set up my account messed up my zip code and failed to send me a copy of my contract  is there anything i can do without going into the store?||@

I am very upset with verizon right now bc no one wants to help me they want to keep sending me somewhere else. i want my acct refunded.  I apologize i did not pay for a prepaid phone I paid for the sim card for prepaid. I already have a droid razer that I wanted to use with this sim card. the piece that holds the sim card broke.  prepaid sim card  49.99  it was the $45 for 1 gb prepaid phone. I could not get it to activate. i called rep and had to take sim card out and it came out of the adapter that I was sent for me to put the sim card in and it broke. Now I cannot even use it. No one seems to be able to activate this either. i was told I had to pay another $45 over the phone. I was told on chat i did not.  it was the $45 1 gb prepaid service.  yes. i have spoke with 10 people  i have been transferred 5 times.  I will contact them. thank you.||@

Thank you for choosing Verizon Prepaid Chat.   My name is Amy. How may I assist you today?   I am really sorry this has happened. and I will do my best to help you.  May I have your name, phone number and the 4 Digits Security Code for the account please?   Thank you for the information, allow me a few seconds to look up the account.  Thank you for holding Kirsten,   I can see in your account, as you mentioned that you change the device and the plan, when you change the plans its like you starting over.  the system remove the present plan, including time left and payment.  You have the option to Auto Pay for the 12th,  the auto pay will start the 12th of next month.  Don't worry Kirsten, I'm talking with my Supervisor to activate the new plan for you.  Go ahead.  Yes, you have the auto pay option set up, and the extra 1gb will be applied as soon as the plan its active.  I can see that you previous plan was for $60.00 and you are long time customer of Verizon.  I'll be happy to activate the plan for you now and you don't have to make a payment.  If you don't mind, the system will use the $6.00 that you have left in the balance and we will credit the difference.  Thank you.  Great news Kirsten, the plan its active now.  You can make a call and test.  Also the extra 1Gb is apply and you have now 2Gb for data.  You can check the data balance dialing #3282 from you device.  Great.  I'm glad to hear that.  Your new plan start today and the end date is September 11th.  Do you want to keep the Auto Pay withdraw day for the 12th or the 11th?  Yes, we recommend for the same date of the plan end date.  Or 1 day prior.  Yes, I can do that.  Its done Kirsten, you should receive a text about the change.  I'm happy that I was able to help you.  I hope you are a 100% satisfied with the service I provided you today!   You are very welcome.   I see that you have been a Verizon Wireless customer since 2013.   How has your overall experience been with Verizon Wireless?  Ohhh... no.  We are happy to assist you, and its faster that get an agent over the phone.  You are right, its faster talk than write.    Anyway... we are here to for you Kirsten.  It was a pleasure assisting you.   Absolutely!   The plan only cover inside US. However, when you travel you will be able to make calls,  you will be charge for International Calls.  Let me look for the charges and make sure that your new device will work in Peru.  Not a problem. One moment please.  Kirsten, you can use your LG G2 in Peru.  The charges for calls will be $1.79 per minute and text $0.50 send and $0.05 receive.  You will have to add additional funds in the account for any international calling charges.  Thank you.  If you have a minute, please click on the End Chat button. To fill out a brief survey about my performance and help us improve our service.   Have a wonderful evening.  And a great and safe Trip.  Peru sounds amazing.  Yes, that is true.  Have fun.  Good night.  I appreciate the Survey.||@Hello - I changed my phone today and I also changed my plan.  But it's screwed up b/c now I have zero gigs and being charged for every text and every call.  310-844-5737  4195  it's a prepaid account  ok  OK - I get that but why didn't it just charge me for the new plan and start now?  So how do I get the service now?  OK ... my other question is about data ..  My boyfriend went to the store today and activated this phone for me and he was told that if I have autopay, there's a promotion that I get more than the 1G of data that is with the $45/month plan ...  But I don't see that being confirmed when I sign up for the $45/month and have autopay  So does that take a month to kick in?  Or does it kick in when I sign up for autopay (i.e. today) ?  OK - awesome.  I will wait til you tell me re: the activation for the new plan ...  OK - that's fine.  Thank you!  OK - awesome.  Thanks ...I will send a text ... one minute.  That was my next question.  I should have the autopay on the day prior, huh?  Or a couple days prior  OK - I can set it for the 10th or you can set it for the 10th ... if it's easier for you, go ahead and make the autopay for the 10th.  OK - thanks  yep - thank you.  I'm complete.  Yes - thank you.  I appreciate it.  It's good.  I have service in a lot of areas other people do not, so I really like that when I'm traveling.  But I gotta say, I'm not liking not being able to talk to someone live ... the chat is a bit awkward.  Except for the wait between responses here ... much faster via voice.  So another question ...  I'm going to Peru in November.  Can I get some sort of plan to cover me just while I'm there and still have the Prepaid account?  Not right now, obviously ... just closer to when I'm leaving.  OK  OK - sounds good.  At least I know what to expect if I choose to use this phone.  That's all for sure now.  OK - will do.  thanks.  You have a good evening, too!  Yeah - Peru is really awesome.  I was there last year for a about two weeks.  This time, I'm taking my boyfriend.  I made friends with a tour guide and we are going to visit her and her family.  Much cheaper to go it alone !  will do - good night.||@

I'd be more than happy to help with this device swap. I have your number pulled up now.  I see the S3 is currently active. What kind of new phone did you get?  Nice! Please turn off your old and new phones for just a moment while I start this activation. I'll let you know as soon as you can turn the new phone back on.  I'm finished! Please turn on only the new phone and try making a call to #832. What message do you hear?  I appreciate you trying that! Please end the call and go to settings&#62; about phone&#62; status. I would like you to find me the IMEI and ICCID (sim) numbers.  No problem! Please restart your phone one more time.   Those numbers match up with what we have on file. Instead of restarting the phone, try that #832 call again. Sometimes there can be a delay in activation. Make sure the old phone is still powered off. I'll also send you a test text message.  Excellent! You can turn your old phone back on now if you want. Other than this activation issue, how has your overall experience with Verizon been? I see you have been a customer since 1996!  That's good to hear!   I did review your plan as well and see you pay for 4GB, but only use 1.6GB on average.  Would you be interested in moving to a 2GB plan to save $20.00 per month?  Give me one moment to change that for you :-) This new plan would start the first day of your next cycle.  The new plan will start on August 19 and will save you $20.00. Your confirmation order number is 388054130.  Now that we have your new phone working and your plan adjusted, have I resolved all your concerns tonight?  Thank you for chatting with me today!

Did you speak with someone regarding your social security number today?  Because of that delay, I think that the 5 PM shipment time was missed.  Just a moment  Let me see if I can do a little more research into this for you.  Rachel, I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. I am not seeing anything in the remarks regarding the shipment being processed. What I will need you to do is call our customer care team that can then put you in touch with our CORE internet sales team that will then be able to find out what has happened with the shipment.   You can reach customer care at 800-922-0204  Again, I am sorry for the delay in shipment.  We will get to the bottom of all of this. The CORE team is specially designed to be able to best serve you.

For you to have the owner My Verizon account you have to register your line first for my verizon, i could unregister all of the lines on your account from my verizon so that you can register first to be the owner and be able to manage your account and view everyones usage  Definitely, I will unregister the accounts for you first  Alright now they are unregistered you can log out and go to verizonWireless.com and register your line at the top right hand corner like when you first registered your line  You won't be able to sign in anymore you have to registter your line for an account as if you didn't have one  Where it says sign in/ register at the top right hand corner, if you hover over it at the bottom there will be a blue link that says register  Then you will enter your 10 digit number and continure  Okay, also you do have 2 managers on your account, would you like for them to have that access on My Verizon as well?  can you provide for Pam and Charlie's Mobile numbers and email address so i can get that set up for them, they will get an email on how to register the manager account  I am so sorry to hear that, so you would like for both your son and grandson to be account managers, I am sorry can you give me the name for each number  Thank you so much, and i will need their email addresses to send the registration emails to as well  great I am adding that information for them, when I finish it will send you a secure pin via text message and i will need for you to send that pin back to me verifying that it is indeed you who wants to add them as account managers  have you recieved that message yet?  Oh okay thank you  Do you have any further questions or concerns I may assist you with?  correct  I have noticed that you are 3 generations of C Richards :)  No? but you went through the entire registration process?  I can't tell you that number but I can however make it to whatever you would like for it to be  it is 4-5 characters consisting of numbers and/or letters  yes you can change it later  that is what it already is  I believe so but let me know if it does not work  Okay if you go back there should be the option Send me a Free Text Message to 254-855-4858 with my Registration PIN  okay I will be here  That's great!   Do you have any further questions or concerns I may assist you with?  I'm so glad we were able to get the My Verizon accounts all sorted out so that you can moniter the usage, and thank you for being with us since 2007, when you are ready to close this session please hit END CHAT and have a wonderful day!||@Hello I am looking at my account online and I can pull up my number but not the other that is on my account to check there usages.

Tiffany thank you so much for allowing me to assist you tonight. Oh no:( I am so sorry to hear that your son has dropped his device in some water. I know how frustrating that can be. May I ask which line is his line?   I do not see that you have insurance on that line, but I do see that this line is eligible for a upgrade.   The Cosmos LG 3 is only $0.99 with a two year agreement.   That iphone would have access to the three GB of data that you have on your plan.||@Hello!  My son dropped his phone in the water and now I need to replace it.  I have my husbands old iphone4 but I don't want to pay data. Is this an option?  It's ok, it was an accident.  His number is 315-719-3372.  His phone was an LG Cosmos Touch  That is correct.  I no longer have any other ""simple"" phones and I don't want a contract if I can help it.

If you are currently on the 2 year plan, you will continue to have that option.  Just to clarify, You mean your contract ended but you haven't upgraded yet?  My name is Shannon too!  To answer your question,  you will still have the option to upgrade on the 2 year option as long as you stay on the More Everything Plan.  I would love to estimate that for you. How much data would you be using monthly?  No worries! I can help you figure it out.  What kinds of things would you and the other person want to do with the new phone?  You probably won't need more that 2GB. Let me set up an estimate based on that.  Do you have a work email so I can check the discount amount that you get for you?  Ok Bernie. Can you give me the name of the company you worked for so that I can pull it up?  It may take me a moment to pull it up.||@I understand that Verizon is going to stop subsiding phones.do you knowww  hen this is going to start  my plans expired awhile ago  that is correct.my name is Bernie.my sons name is Shannon,he married a girl named shannon  what would it cost to put 2 iphones on  no idea.i never had a smart phone.i do have awi-fi hot spot in the house with unlimited data  e,mail,check the internet some banking,no texting  forgot to mention I have an employees discount  no I am retired  verizon||@

Thank you for fully verifying with me. :)  What is keeping you from getting into your account? Is it the password?  I can help you reset your password to the same thing!

I completely understand how plans can be a concern of yours. I will gladly assist you with plan information. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?  Thanks Rebecca.   While I'm getting your account pulled up, may I ask how has your overall experience been with Verizon Wireless?  I completely understand your concerns. We do appreciate your loyalty. The price right now is our biggest concern.  You do have the device plan where your lines will be $15 because you are paying for your phone in monthly installments but you would have to change your plan to the 6GB data plan or higher.  That is correct. It is really not a savings because you are paying for your phone in monthly installments.  You are more than welcome. It has been our absolute pleasure working with such an amazing customer. Before we part ways, have we addressed all of your needs to ensure exceptional service with Verizon?  You were amazing! :) Thank you for chatting with me today and being a valued Verizon customer.   You can also find us on Twitter at @VZWSupport.  Please click on the ?End Chat? button to end this chat.||@I was just wondering about the new plan you are offering with data and only $15 per smartphone and $10 per tablet.  Would this reduce my current monthly bill at all?  Rebecca Alhasoun 8015730761  great, just getting rather pricey  been with Verizon for over 15 years and can't complain  So I would save $10 per line, but pay more for 6gb of data, so really no savings in switching?  OK thanks  yes||@

What can I assist you with today?  I can certainly understand not needing the insurance package for the device and I can work to remove the package on this end if you wish Andy!   Just a moment please as I access the account on this end  I have your account up on this end for you now! Thanks for your patience in advance as I review the lines  And thanks for being a customer since 2006! While I am reviewing over the account on this end for you, how has your overall experience with Verizon been?  That is great to hear! I am seeing that the line 5077 has insurance for $11 with the total mobile protection package, and for the line 8759 you have total mobile protection at $10. May I ask which of these you are looking to remove?  One moment please  I am seeing that niether of the lines on this end have Apple Care according to our systems  It would be best to have them doublecheck, but since you have insurance on the line it is possible that the device was instead replaced through Asurion  Then it is very possible that the line had Apple Care on it, but I would be unable to check that on this end  I completely understand! That is the course of action that I would recommend! And with Asurion, there is a one time deductible per claim done on the line, and you can always check the deductible per device at http://phoneclaim.com/verizon/deductible  You are very welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with to ensure that you have had exceptional service with Verizon?||@Yes, thank you. I just switched to a new plan and I have a $10 per month charge for Total Mobile Protection that I don't think I need.  Ok, I just had my total cost reduced significantly, so I am very happy about that.  Can you tell if I have Apple Care on these phones?  I think I have Apple care on 919-818-8759, because I had the phone replaced once. Would I need to contact Apple to check on that?  I went to the Apple Store to have my phone replaced, if that tells you anything.  Ok, thanks. Why don't we defer taking any action at this time. I will check with Apple to see if I have Apple Care.  But can you tell me how the Asurion coverage works. Is there a deductible and a fee like there was with Apple Care?  Thanks. l will check with Apple and see if I need to do anything with my Verizon coverage, but in the meantime leave everything as it is.  No. You have been very helpful. Verizon Chat is the best.||@

It would be pleasure to assist you today. While I'm accessing your account, how are you today?  I am great. How are you?  Good! thanks for asking   You're welcome.  What's the questions you have for me about your bill?  Ok. So I recently upgraded my phone from an Iphone 5 to an Iphone 6. The ONLY reason I switched phones was because it showed I was eligable for an upgrade at discount price because I stayed un my contract for the 2 years. Well, anyway I went into verizon and they put me on the edge plan. I'm not understanding why I am paying a full price for the phone. Its like 27 a month for the phone on the edge program,and I will be paying this for 2 years? It showed that I could get the iphone 6 for $299 since I had a upgrade.  When you went into the store to upgrade your device when the line was out of contract did you tell them you wanted to pay the 2 year upgraded discounted price?  Yes. I told them that is the reason for my visit. She was like ""Okay"" and then I looked at the Iphone 6 and decided on that phone. And then she started explaining the edge program.. But did not say I was paying full price. I am very upset regarding this,and the fact that my bill went from $70 to $105 when ALL i wanted to do was upgrade my phone with the discount I was offered.  I definitely understand what your saying and know your upset and I would be as well if I was not explained the full benefits of the edge. allow me an brief moment to look into some resources on getting the edge removed and you paying the discounted price for the Iphone 6.  Okay, thank you.  Thank you for your patience   Yes, you're welcome.  How's the weather where you at today?  I'm in Florida, so it's been pretty hot today, and rainy.  Really! I can't wait to come back down there to visit.  Where do you visit?  In Miami   Oh, Okay!  My brother stays down there.  he plays semi pro football  Wow, that's great!!  Yea hopefully he gets drafted.  What I would recommend is taking the phone back to the store and speaking with the manager to let him know that this is not what you wanted and just noticed you were getting charged for the device and they will be able to cancel the edge agreement and you will be bale to get the phone at the discounted price.  Okay, thank you for your help! I hope the best with your brother's football career. Thank you again'  Thank you so much and you're welcome   Are there any other questions or concerns for me today?||@

I see that line 9302 is currently out of contract, so we can absolutely disconnect this for you with no fees involved! One moment while I complete this for you.   Okay! Your device will stop working today. You will receive a refund for access charges that were paid in advance for the rest of the current billing cycle. Your final bill may include delayed roaming, feature or airtime charges plus taxes. Once the line is disconnected, voicemails cannot be retrieved. If you decide to reactivate your service, you will be charged a $25 reactivaton fee. You can only reactivate an E911-compliant device and there is no guarantee of getting the same number back. Will this be okay?  Okay, great! Your line 9302 has been disconnected successfully.   Okay, sure!  Yes, absolutely! One moment, please.   And which lines was this plan added to?  Thank you!

I'm very sorry the website is giving you trouble with adding the data, and I can certainly help get this taken care of today.  While I'm getting your information pulled up, may I ask how your overall experience has been with Verizon Wireless?  That is great to hear :)   I see you are currently on our 4GB More Everything plan, is it our 6GB plan you were making the change to?  Thank you. For the change, did you want it set up to where it is effective for this cycle, or to start with your new billing cycle on 9/10/15?  That is the option I would go with myself :)    Yes they do, and I'm glad you recognize that :)    The change to the 6GB More Everything plan just finished processing for you, so if you refresh your My Verizon account, you should see the change there.  Other than changing the data amount, were there any questions or concerns you had about the account today Carlos?  No need to apologize, that email can be very confusing :)  With the plan being backdated to the start of this cycle, what that will do on your upcoming bill is charge the difference in the cost of the 4GB plan and the 6GB plan for the cycle you are in, and the normal billing portion that is for the month in advance will be billed at the 6GB rate.  This makes the bill right after the change a bit more than it will be going forward.  Also, those emails do not factor in any discounts you have on the lines.  You are more than welcome :)  It has been great to chat with you, and I hope you have a great day as well!  Chat back in anytime at all if you have further questions, and thank you very much for chatting in with me today and being an incredibly valued Verizon customer!

How are you today?  Sorry for the long wait.  I am so sorry to hear that you seemed to have a high data usage even though you have not been able to use the service these past few days.  I certainly understand how frustrating it can be. Don't worry, we'll do everything we can do check on this and we'll see what we can do about it.  Let me pull up your account real quick, okay?  I appreciate all the information you have provided, Ray.  I am now checking your account and I am able to see here that your highest usage for the last 3 months is 5.990GB data. When did you start experiencing this high in data usage?  I understand. Do you have a secure password on your JetPack?  I see. Do you disable or turn the JetPack off when not in use?   I appreciate the information.   Computer or laptop uses a large amount of data compared to mobile devices. Computer or laptop require a large amount of data even when you are just opening and email or loading a certain website or webpage.  I am now validating the data usages on your account.  We have this awesome tool where it can validate the usages on a customer's account.   With this, we'll be able to verify if the current usage we are seeing are valid.  I am sorry about that, Ray. I certainly understand where you are coming from. I will take note of your feedback and will surely pass it to the team that best handle this type of feedback.   My pleasure.   I am done checking your data usages and upon reviewing, the current data usages on your account are valid.   I am sorry as we don't have the option to further check on the detailed usage. However, the tool that we use can able to check the valid data usages made on each line on your account. Most of the data usage came from your 3820 line. This line consumed a total of 6.596GB data.  I was able to see here that you bill cycle will end on August 13, 2015. Your new bill cycle will start on August 14, 2015. We still have around 2.3GB to use until the your data will refresh back to 10GB. You have mentioned that your JetPack was diagnosed as damaged, right?  I definitely understand, Ray. You may contact our Customer Service at 800-922-0204. They may able to provide you more options on how to validate the data usages on your account. They are open from Monday to Friday, 8Am to 6PM EST.   It is possible that there is a problem. If this issue is only being experienced when you got the new JetPack, it is possible that the reason would be the JetPack.  I appreciate the information. i have noted everything we have talked about on your account. Our Customer Service will exactly know what to do about this matter.  You are most welcome.   Is there anything else I can help you with?  Thank you for being a part of our Verizon Family! You can also find us on Twitter at @VZWSupport. Please click on the ""END CHAT"" button to end this chat.||@I cannot understand the unusually high data usage this month. We did not use the computor for an extended length of time due to being gone from home. In addition our jet pack quit working and needed to be replaced. That is according to our local Verizon store. In addition we continually lose internet connections. This has been going on all month. I certainly cannot understand this high usage! We do not do any video wtching, or gameing. I see my account shows usage for both. Please explain.  As you can see we have not used anywhere near the amount of data being accumilated this month. The only thing we downloaded that amounted to a large amount of data was the updates for both our phones. those are a Verizon update and certainly should not have gone against our usage.  As a matter of fact, one of the phones was updated in the Verizon store, on Verizon's WiFi. The other I did at home when we got the new JetPack.  Just this month. Or should I say just the last week. At least I think. I never had the need to check data usage until I accidentally found it on my new JetPack. I was scrolling through the avaialable data, trying to understand why we cannot get connections with our phones.  It came with the JetPack. The store representative taped it on the back of the device. Nobody has seen it. We live by ourselves, in the country. I have repeatedly checked the unit when it is on. there is always only one user on, the computer.  Yes. It is always turned off when I am not online. I only get online every couple of days or so. There may be 3-4 days that I do not turn the device on. We use the smart phone to send/recieve many messages. We very seldom email.  I understand. But again, comparing the data usage from previous months, this month is way out of line. It is the same computer. Nothing has changed, except the new JetPack just this month. By the way I feel I had to pay a very large sum just for the new Jetpack. The old one was only 2 years old. Verizon should not have outdated it so soon. Very unhappy with this situation as well.  Thank you. I would be very interested in their response.  Not sure what that means. If it is valid, what data was consumed. I see the majority of data used was the computer. As I explained, this computer was not on for a good portion of the month. The I-Phones continually lose internet connections, so I know they didn't use it! There has to be a logical explanation for where the data was consumed.  That is the computer line. I need to talk to someone in person. I don't think the amount of data will be a concern, as to going over limit. The data is reset I believe tomorrow. But I have to understand where the high amount of data is being used. I do not want to have to re-visit this problem again next month. The last time something similar to this occurred, about a year ago, I think Verizon discovered a problem with connection; not real sure. But since that time we have not had any problems, nor have we used anywhere near the limit of available data. Something is wrong with the system, and it sure points toward the new JetPack. This is the only change made this month. Someone at Verizon needs to find out why so much data is being consumed. As I mentioned, the computer, AND the JetPack are turned off when I am not online. And I am NOtz online that often.  No Venessa, the old JetPack was not damaged. The Verizon representative said that style of JetPack is out of date, and will no longer work. The battery was dead, and according to her, the unit will not accept a charge once this occurs.  I will contact customer service Friday Venessa. Thank you for your time and effort to resolve my problem.  I do not believe so, goodbye.||@

Give me just a moment ot review your message.  Great question.  I will be happy to help you with your upgrades tonight.  No pricing will change with a upgrade or transferred upgrade, only the next upgrade date.  What new phones will you be getting with your upgrades?  Nice choice! The iPhone 5 is at a really great price, plus the battery life is great, along with a awesome 8 MP iSight camera.  Go ahead and get the phones added to your cart, I will be right here to help you with checking out.  Great! Let me know when you have the phones in your cart.  No, not at all. The pricing will stay the same for each line, it will just move the line that the upgrade was taken from up by two years.  Let's double check, go ahead and get the phones in your cart. We can take a look at it on the Review Order page.  Ahhh the waiting spinner!  Gotcha, give it a moment to do its thing!  Try refreshing that page a couple of times.  Exactly right!  What page are you currently on?  Try deleting your browsing history to get the failed login attempts cleared out.  How are things going for you?  No good.  Hmmm, let me see.  Sure, you should be able to do that.  Right, don't want to interrupt service!  Just for fun, click on add a line. See if that will continue to the next page.  Let me know what happens.  What if you did them as adding a new line, then you can contact Customer Care tomorrow and have them correct it, and put them as upgrades to the correct lines. Leave the grunt work with Customer Care.  I've actually have to do that before, it was a pretty quick and easy process.  Was the phone a new phone, or a certified pre-owned phone?  The certified pre-owned will not be available to check in store inventory. Let me see what we can offer that does. One moment.  You are more than welcome!  We currently offer the iPhone 5C, for $ .99. It will allow you to check store inventory online.  Hmmm, I have no idea.  I'm looking for it now.  things can change quickly with Verizon, still looking.  Still looking, one moment.  The certified pre owned devices are brought to like new condition, a new screen, battery and any non working parts are replaced.  It is a pretty great buy!  What model iPhone have you had?  The 5C is pretty much like the 5 or 5S, just no finger print scanner to unlock the phone.  It will function just like the other two phone with the same iOS software.  The pre-owned 5 still?  We just currently have the iPhone 5 Certified Pre-Owned as a pre-paid device.  Would a new 5C be of interest?  Just $ .99 on a two year contract.  True, it is a plastic backing, we can always get a protective case to take care of that!  The screen would be the same size as a 5 or 5S.  Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  You are more than welcome! I'm sorry I could not help you do moer.  Thank you for visiting Verizon Wireless, I hope I was able to offer you an outstanding experience and look forward to speaking with you again. Have a great evening!||@Hi there! I would like to upgrade one of the lines of my account. The phone I want to upgrade does NOT have upgrade available, but two other lines DO have upgrade availability. My question is...I know I can upgrade the account that has one available, then when it comes, switch the two phones on the two lines? But my further question is, does it then make what ""they owe"" each month the opposite/eachothers?  Uria Scaplen  Thanks...you too! :)  ok..  cool...thanks!  I would like to upgrade the 7768 account or ""transfer"" it to the 3353 account...to get that line a iphone 5 $.99 phone?  Yes...:)  ok...soo one question....the 7768 account only is charged $17 and change a month and the 3353 is like $22 something...so once they swap...will it effect the $17 something on the 7768  But I think the $17 pricing is ""special pricing"" bc it hasn't been upgraded?  It's accessing my account! with a spinner...one second  not sure whats taking so long :-/  im clicking on upgrade devices, right?  oh man...I have signed out and signed back in refreshed waited....its just not going past this point! :(  accessing spinner...just after clicking upgrade devices  I can click around anywhere else....but when I click here...I get this FOREVER  Tried that...now using a different browser and its doing the same thing :(  Can I switch the device before and that transfer the upgrade?  maybe not...would mess up calls coming to each of them in the meantime that this one is mailed...nevermond  haha  dang I can click anywhere else fast...except upgrade a device  goes right thru to the next page  to scared that it wont be ""ok"" haha  Maybe I will run into a store tonight...do you have a way of knowing who has that .99 cent phone in my area?  i want to say certfied pre-owed? what do you have at that price?  ok thanks  I am only seeing the 5C now...how come I can't find the 5 pre-owned I saw earlier?  do you see it?  I was on my phone doing the upgrade a couple hours ago...and it let me pick black or white 8 or 16 and it was .99?  ugh... :(  Would you suggest pre-owned 5 or New 5c?  so better that the ""c""? I haven't had one of those?  5s right now...waiting for my upgrade to the 6 or something else to come out :)  4, 5, 5s  hmmm...I will have to check out the differences...meanwhile...no finding the pre-owned?  Will stores have them or only online  don't see it on my end  dang...shouldn't have waited I guess :( didn't know a couple hours made a difference :(  That is what I will have to research...it has good reviews...just not sure of the differences? I know the ""non-c"" has better camera? and the c is like plastic of something right?  does the c have a bigger screen than the 5?  is the screen bigger?  oh ok... hmmmm...I will ask! haha! thanks for your help! I saw where I can search for what stores have that one....may just have to keep my eye out for the pre-owned to pop back up! ugh!  No I really appreciate all your time!!! I can't believe it still won't work and let me upgrade!!!||@

Thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless Sales Chat. I am here to provide you with outstanding service. Who do I have the pleasure of chatting with today?   It's nice to meet you Lauren, ! How can I help you today?   I wold be more than happy to help you pick out a really great hotspot for him to use during his travels.  How many wifi enabled devices will he have connected to it at one time?  Great!  We currently offer some really great hotspot pricing on a 2 year contract.  Let me get you a link to the hotspot so you can give it a look for yourself!  I'm sending the link now, just copy and paste it into your browser.  http://www.verizonwireless.com/internet-devices/ellipsis-jetpack-mhs800l/  Let me know that the link opened for you.  Awesome!  That will work perfectly for his business travels, plus it is small enough to fit into his pocket.  It will be $20 monthly access.  As many times as he wants!  Do you currently have a Verizon wireless data plan?  Awesome! He can use it as many times as he wants to , it will just share off of your current data plan.  Is your currently have a unlimited data plan?  Ok, gotcha. Then you are correct Lauren, he can the current data plan as many times as he likes.  Take a look at how much he uses the hotspot the first month, then you can look at adjusting the data plan if it is still not being used up.  Lets get the hotspot in your cart, I will be happy to help you with checking out.  I have limited access, I can try. What would you like for me to look at?  You would be able to contact Customer Care for that line.  We can go ahead and get the hotspot ordered tonight, then seeing if you can cancel that line will be a quick and easy call to Customer Care.  Let me know when you have the hotspot in your cart.  I do not have a end date for the device, but it could end at any time.  We do have a 14 day return period where you could return it if it did not meet either of your expectations.  I can see if a supervisor can look into any fee for canceling the line if you want.  Sorry, just thought of that option!  That sounds like a plan!  Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  You are more than welcome!  Thank you for visiting Verizon Wireless, I hope I was able to offer you an outstanding experience and look forward to speaking with you again. Have a great evening!||@Hi there, my name is Lauren Lewis.  You too! I'm wondering what kind of mobile hotspots you have.  Looking for something for my husband to use for business when he's traveling and doesn't have access to an internet connection  Just 1  Very cool!  Yep! Have it opened now.  Wonderful that's what we were looking for.  How does it work pricing wise?  How often would he be able to use it for that $20/month?  Yes sir.  So, it's the 99cent for the device with a 2 year contract, plus $20 per month with unlimited usage sharing on the current data plan?  No. I believe we have 4 1/2 gigs of data, but we typically use less than 50% of our plans amount  For example, we have 2.96 gigs left of usage, with only 3 days left in our billing cycle  Do you have the ability to look at the rest of my account before we do that?  Well I have a phone line that I do not use anymore.  Am wanting to see if I can cancel that line without a penalty, save the money from that, and then add on the hotspot.  Well, let me check with my husband on this when he gets back to his hotel tonight.  How long will that product and price be available for?  Let me check with him after I call customer support, but I can assure you that if everything goes as I expect it we will be getting the device. Thank you for your help  Not a problem, I don't want to take up any more of your time if it's a problem, I just have to check with him as it'll be a business expense for him and it'll have to get approved before we can make any concrete decision  That will be all for now! Thanks so much||@

While I'm getting your account pulled up, may I ask how has your overall experience been with Verizon Wireless?  That is good to hear. I am getting the cost for you at this time.   Thank you for holding. The 4GB plan would be about $88 per month.  It will be a monthly device plan.  You can upgrade when 100% of the phone is paid off.   Are you still with me?  It will not.

I would be delighted to assist you with looking into your account and the phones you mentioned! May I ask who I have the pleasure of speaking with today?    Hello Jolanta!  Feel free to call me Mandy even though it states Amanda. How has your day been so far? Great I hope!  I am getting your information pulled up now.    Alright Jolanta, let me see what is going on.  I am reviewing the account information.  I definitely want to help however I can.  So I see where you chatted in and discussed some changes.  It appears that the discounts that were mentioned will be added to the line after August 19, 2015.  Did they share that information along with the quotes and expectations of the first bill cycle?  So you decreased your plan too, correct?  Alright Jolanta, when you decrease plan minutes or data, we future date the bill so that the costs you have already incurred will be covered so that is definitley one thing that will be happening and there is an order to disconnect that line and decrease the plan.  I am verifying the other information that was emailed to you now  That plan is what I am showing that will become effective in just 7 days.  Also, with a plan change there is a one time month in advance charge for the line access so that is what you are seeing the $30.00 charges on lines ending in -0938 and -4757.  Then your bill will become regular every month before the taxes and surcharges are assessed.  You will have 2 basic phones at $30.00 a piece on the $60.00 plan and then your employee discount will be applied so it will be around $45.00 before the taxes and surcharges.  For the phones and $60.00 for the plan  That is what you have now. So, when the change in plan takes effect on the 19th, each phone will be $30.00 and then the plan is $5.00/onth  Making your total monthly charges $65.00 before taxes and surcharges.  Does that make sense?  No problem.  I am here to help and I definitely want to get the right fit for your family Jolanta.  Give me just a moment to process the order on the account.  So keep the line ending in 0052 cancelled?  So keep the plan the same you have now the one you are paying $60.00 a month for also?  Ok Jolanta.  I have cancelled the plan change order that you had in effect.  Also, I would be happy to walk you through the steps on changing the devices for you so that you and your brother can trade phones at your convenience and when you are certain any information you need is backed up.  And then we can go ahead and disconnect that line.  That is one other thing that was going to have to be done as I can not future date disconnects.  Are you ready to do that now, I can help you through it?  Alright!  So you are in the My Verizon site, correct?  Great!  As soon as we get the devices changed, I can go ahead and process the disconnect order again.  Over over the ""My Devices"" tab and the drop down menu displays, do you see that?  Choose the ""Activate/Switch device""  You will select Switch Device and choose the line ending in 0052 to switch with, let me know when you have done this step  Great! Jolanta.  Move through each step to complete the process and let me know when you have completed them so I can step back in, make sense?  Awesome!!  Let me know if you run into any issues and I am here for you.  Send the text to any phone, best to choose 0938 number just to be safe  Let me know when you have completed this step Jolanta.  Give me one second to make sure we have the right numbers selected, I am going to make my screen see exactly what you see in My Verizon  Send the code to the -4757 line to make sure we get the text and then we can proceed, ok?  The LG Accolade  It is a free text message.  It will come through for the activation information to be provided to you  Let me know that you got it and then we can proceed to the next steps  Jolanta, you have to enter the authorization code in My Verizon before we do the *228 activation steps.  You are doing awesome!  And yes, proceed with the free test call and once the activations for both the phones are complete, I can disconnect the 0052 line.  Jolanta, that is why I mentioned being ready to switch them and to make sure they were backed up before we proceeded.  There is really  no way to retrieve them now, I am so sorry for your brother!!  Thank you for understanding!  It could be viewed as a scavenger hunt to make him feel better about it.  Jolanta, the bills that are available through My Verizon lists all the calls made from each line for the month and you can go back pretty far!  So, both lines are switched and activated now?  Or, your brother does  Ok, just let me know when you get there  Just checking on you, is your line activation completed?  You can perform the test by dialing #832  Absolutely!  Just let me know when you complete it and then we will disconnect the 0052 line  Did the test call work?  The statements available in My Verizon will not disappear even if we deactivate the line.  You can review them anytime and as often as you need to in order to get them back.  We can hold off on the disconnect if you would like though.  Alright, bear with me one moment while it goes through.  Just another moment  The system is working, just another moment  Almost there, just another sec. I really appreciate your patience with me  Ok Jolanta, you are all set!  I do need to mention that the device will stop working some time after 7:30 PM on 8/18/2015. Your final bill may include delayed roaming, feature or airtime charges plus taxes. Once the line is disconnected, voicemails cannot be retrieved.  If you decide to reactivate your service, you will be charged a $25 reactivaton fee. And, you can only reactivate an E911-compliant device and there is no guarantee of getting the same number back.  Does that all make sense?  It was future dated and you can use the phone until it shuts off under the current plan.  I am going to send an email to review what we did today, but just to recap; we cancelled the future dated order for the plan change that was originally suppose to go into effect on August 19, 2015.  You have decided to stay on the current plan of Nationwide Talk Family Share Primary 700.  We proceeded the switching of devices for -0052 and -0938 and made this the primary line on the account.  And, I processed the disconnect for -0052.  Was there anything else I can do for you?  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to work with you today. I wish you good weather and good fortune!! Have a wonderful evening! If you are certain that you have no further questions or concerns, please go ahead and press the ""end chat"" button. Just a friendly reminder, you can check your balance, usage, upgrade dates, and much much more any time on My Verizon. Again, my name was Amanda and it was my pleasure assisting you today!  Thank you so much!!!  It was a pleasure Jolanta.  Good luck to your brother; you are a doll for helping him retrieve all his contacts!  You too!! Good night.  If you are certain that you have no further questions or concerns, please go ahead and press the ""end chat"" button.  Again, thank you so much for being the best part of Verizon!||@Hi Amanda. I need help understanding what transpired yesterday.  We were offered a quote of $45 for two phones starting next billing cycle (19th of Aug.) and we received an email saying its near twice that.  My name is Jolanta.  Happy Wednesday to you too.  It was good until my dad pulled up his email.  He's hoping I can help fix it.  Mandy, I'm counting on you.  Thank you dear.  Not at all. She told me it would be $45 plus tax for the next billing cycle and my line (609-306-0052) would be taken off.  I would love to know what kind of discounts will be reflected on the 19th.  Yes, that's the plan.  My brother's line (609-306-0938) will become the primary line.  And he will take my phone as it's a newer generation than his.  Okay.  I'm not sure if the minutes will be decreased, however. We were explained to that there would be unlimited text and 700 minutes of talk time.  We currently have 700 minutes shared between three lines and a limit for texting.  OH okay. So the regular every month before taxes and surcharges will be $45 for both lines combine?  Now I understand. Thank you. So the discount will be applied for the first month too? (...and in addition the $30 per phone).  Okay, my dad is right now thinking that he would like to reverse this change.  He's thinking it would be better if we stick to the current plan we have at the moment.  Sorry for the confusion Mandy.  Thank you. I am still leaving the family plan, however, and we can have my brother as the primary with the Cosmos 2 (my current phone). :)  Yes, thank you.  And we need the 609-306-0938 number associate with the Cosmos 2.  Yes. That's what he wants.  Thank you for all your help.  Okay, let's do this Mandy. Sounds good to me.  yes  yes, I see the options  ok, need to resign in  Ah... I see it!  Yup.  Okay, so I'm at the authorization code part.  UHM... so I'm totally confused what the ""new phone"" is. It's asking me to send *228 to the ""new phone"".  Sure thing.  ok  So Cosmos first generation  Oh... the flip phone. she does not have texting on her phone.  but I can dial it.. dugh... sorry.  oh ok  Ok, I called *228 to the flip phone and hit #1.  Was that correct? There's no txt yet.  oh, that was completed.  It's asking to do that activation thing now.  Then it asks me to do a free test call.  Sounds good. I did not know that my brother's phone was going to be cleared of contacts too. Any way to get them back.  My numbers are backed up.  Woops!  Somehow I didn't think his were going to get erased. Well, what's done is done.  haha... I don't think he wants to hear that now.  Is there a way I can access this pas months phone calls made in/out from his phone?  Woo hoo! Looks like I've got homework. haha..  I called *228 on his phone. not on mine just yet.  ok.  Ok, my phone is now cleared too. I lost the screen with the second code # to test the phones.  yey! thanks.  Super, yes it did. I'm wondering though if we deactivate the 0052 number, which is now my brother's cell. Will I be able to pull up his in/out calls?  Ok, if that information is not going to disapear than lets proceed with the deactivation.  No problem. :)  It's all good.  Gasp, it's a sign! lol...  If it does not work I we can do this another time.  No biggie.  Oh, no worries, I have lot's of work finding his contacts. Keeping busy here.  Yes, so don't use my phone any more or I can be charged for roaming.  Is that correct?  Mandy it was a pleasure talking with you today.  Thank you for helping us through this hump and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.  You really have a great personality!  Thanks, I messed up so it's my responsibility to clean up. :)  Have a great rest of the week.  :)  Welcome!||@

Oh no! I'd be happy to help you with this do you have insurance?  Okay one moment while I try to see what I can do.   There is if you have Total Mobile Protection there is a website you can go to, to locate it via GPS.  We do offer Total mobile protection as on of our Insurance options you would have needed Total Mobile protection prior to losing it to use the GPS feature.   Since you have had insurance on this line for more the 30 days you can file a claim with asurion and they can talk to you about getting a new phone.   I am sorry but, to keep track of your phone you would need Total Mobile Protection not Wireless phone protection. If you can not find your phone Asurion can send you a new phone. I am sorry If I was not clear but from my understanding was you asked if we can track phones. That is how we can track a phone.   I have not heard from you for a few moments.

Yes  just got off the phone with them.  but is there a way to track the location  the reason I ask is that a photo of a screenshot was uploaded to my Facebook account a little while ago  is that the insurance?  my phone number is 425-280-5287  I already temporarily suspended the service  that really doesn't answer my questoin  finally got someone on the phone.  I'll talk to them||@

I'm thinking about switching to verizon from ATT since you guys have that really nice promotion going, but i was wondering how much longer it would last?

Ok, when I'm ready to switch would it be easier to do it online or should I go into a store? I want to save both numbers  ok perfect, I really dont want to miss the promo opportunity. Would you guys be able to give some notice of when it would end? Or would verizon stop is suddenly?

I will do the best I can to get this taken care of for you today.  So I have news for you. As Im looking at your account. You were charged for a month in advance fee for changing to a new plan of 10gb so you were charged 80.00 dollars extra, your next month bill will be around 200.00-210.00  Your next month bill will be 202.00  Yes that is correct. Whenever you change plans you get charge a month in advance fee.   Yes that is correct.   Okay did you make these changes in the store?  Thanks for that information. If he was suppose to upgrade that line and not be on the edge plan then he will need to go to the store, so they can fix the error, and credit those charges back.   Okay. I will submit an request so you can get this all straietned out for you. Im sorry you had to expeirence this.   *experience.   *straightened   Yes its okay.

I was told my bill was going to be about 210 a month and now its showing as 250  So i was charged extra for changing from an old plan to a new one?  Alright and the 0009 Line are we paying installments for the Iphone?  Why? He was supposed to recieve that as free upgrade under his previous plan before shifting to our plan  Yes we were with a sales rep  Well he went to the store about a week after we did this and the sales rep that helped us had apparently ""left for a competitor"".  Because originally we were trying to get his number ported into our plan which apparently did not work  Well the Sales rep working was a Friend of his Ex so we figured we were in great hands. Obviously we were both mistaken  Alright Thank you  Nope that is all of it Thank You||@

May I ask how has your overall experience been with Verizon?  I'm so glad to hear your issue was resolved Kathy. Let's get started with your question. With the More Everything Plan the 25GB of cloud storage is free.  Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that happened. In order to start your claim process you would need to file a claim online at http://www.phoneclaim.com/verizon  May I ask what is the make and model of her device?  Thank you, the deductible for that device is $99.  That line is eligible for a Certified Pre Owned. For that device it would be $49.99 and it would extend the contract for 2 additional years.  Yes that's correct.  Kathy, thank you for the opportunity to service you today and to provide you with account information. It has been our absolute pleasure working with such an amazing customer.

Kathy Kilgore  I had some issues the last few weeks with upgrading our data plan, but part of the mistake was refunded.  I was a little frustrated that I was mislead and am paying more than I thought I would be.  Other than that, we are fairly happy with your service.  Ok, great.  We have the Total Mobile Protection on our phones.  My daughter dropped her phone today and shattered the screen.  What are our options?  Can you tell me what a replacement cost would be?

Well, I can tell you that surfing in the internet, watching online videos and streaming music, that runs out the data right away. Let me give you the link with the data calculator so you can see what uses it up and what doesn't.  I also suggest you to turn off the data option whenever you're using wifi.  Here is the link.  http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/splash/dataShareCalculator.jsp?intcmp=INT-SEA-NON-SE-data_calculator-031615-DE-SR-SU-T  Correct.  Effectively, iMessage requires data to work  Actually not, basically an iMessage does not use not even 500KB.  1 MB = 1,024 KB, 1 GB = 1,024 MB.  Yes, that is correct. For $5 you can add 512MB, for $10 you can add 1GB and for $20 you can add 3GB.  Always glad to help!

My name is Kaci.  Last night I set up a prepaid plan with Verizon for the first time and I just have a question about data usage.  I know I get 1 GB of data but I was wondering how I know how much I am using. Because I went to settings in my phone and looked under cellular data usage and it has said 30.1 GB ever since I got it last night.  I have been on wifi most all day today so I know I haven't used much if any today either.  Kaci Graham and the phone number is 386-365-4628.  I think the security code is 4628.  Ok, thank you.  Very good, thank you.  Yes you are right about that!  Ok that's good. This is my first time having to worry about going over on data usage as I used to be a straight talk customer until yesterday.  Is there a way I can somehow limit my data usage to where I can try to make that 1 GB last for a month? I'm not sure what uses it up and what doesn't.  Ok that would be great.  I honestly don't do any of the things that you mentioned there.  Oh so my phone can still use data when I'm connected to wifi?  Wow, didn't know that.  Does iMessage use up data? I was told it did but wasn't sure.  I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake by switching over from straight talk because I do use iMessage quite a bit.  Okay so I guess that's not too bad.  And I can add data on this prepaid plan if I want, correct?  Okay, sounds good.  Thank you for helping.  I think that'll do it! Thank you!||@

We can definitely go over that for you! I am getting into the account for you now and I will take a look and see what would change! :)   So it looks like you have 6GB for $70.00, and then you have the lines out of contract. Allow me a moment to do some calculations and see if you are better on your current plan or a new one! :)   What I can do for you now is go ahead and apply a discount, that would make your lines $15 for your smartphone, and then $20.00 for your basic phone, and then $10.00 for your tablet. This would total you at $130.00 before taxes. On the new plan it would be $130.00 too! So either way, whether I add discounts today or change the plan tomorrow, it will be the same!   When you upgrade and you still have your current plan you can either go with the two year contract, [line access $40.00] or you can go with the device payment [Line access $15 + Device payment} .  On the new plan they are, on the More Everything plan the Smartphones get a discount. Going forward on the new plan ALL phones will be $20.00 per month. Also, on the new plan, you will not be able to ever star a new two-year contract, going forward it will be only device payment.   On the new plan it would be $60.00 plan, and then $20.00 for each phone, and then $10.00 for the tablet.  Yes  You can either get the 2-Year Contract [Line access would be $40.00], or you can get a Device Payment Program phone [Line access $15.00 + Payment], or full-retail would be just [$15 line access] you do not have to change to the new plan.  We just updated our pricing for that promotion and what it was was customers moving old plans to new prices. You can still do this! I see that you are on the 6GB for $80.00, and we can bump you up to the 10GB for $80.00! Would you like me to do that?   We can change you to the new 6GB which is $70.00!   Yes!   Sounds like a plan! I will go ahead and start making that change for you and get you a confirmation number when the change is made! :)   While I am making the change for you, I would like to say I do see that you have been a customer with us for quite some time ! On behalf of Verizon Wireless, we would like to say Thank You! We definitely appreciate you being a valued Verizon wireless customer for that time! If you do not mind me asking, how has your overall experience with Verizon been in that time? We appreciate any feedback.  Yes, you are correct, you are getting the same service for a discount now!   I am definitely sorry that you were not aware that you were able to get a discount when your contract runs out! It is a fairly new discount that we have offered, so I can understand that you may not have been aware! We try to advertise as much as possible though! I have made that change for you and it is effective on the first day of your Current billing cycle which is 07/14/2015, your confirmation number for this change is 438527519 .  I did! :) I hope that you have a great night! Chat back in anytime at all if you have further questions, and thank you very much for chatting in with me today and being an incredibly valued Verizon customer!

If I keep 6GB and the same devices, will my monthly charges be less?  That's what I'm thinking.  With the new plan, if I wait to upgrade my phone for another 6-12 months, it winds up being cheaper.  How does it work when I try to upgrade?  I didn't know that - when your contract is up you can get a discount.  And on the newer plans, my choices would be (1) pay full price for the phone or (2) 2 year contract or (3) payment plan?  Why is the smartphone $15 and the basic phone $20?  Shouldn't they be the same?  How does the bill break down on the newer plan?  Both have unlimited text and talk minutes?  What happens if I buy a new phone and I'm still on the More Everything?  On the ""More Everything"", was there an option to get more data for the same price I was paying now?  I saw that promotion but never switched.  What if I want to stay with 6GB?  Is that a little cheaper?  Or the only option is to switch for 10GB for $80?  So I can switch to 6GB for $70 and then get $15/$15/$20/$10 for my four devices?  So $130 per month, ok, let's just change that.  And I can always switch to the new plan later - it doesn't really make a difference since it somes out the same.  OK, let's do that change.  So I'm getting the same service, but for $70 less.  But when I buy a new phone I should pay the full amount.  Well, the main thing is, I didn't know that you could get a discount when your contract expired.  Oh, thanks, you made it retroactive for a month!  ok, bye  bye end chat||@

I understand you saw the promotion on our website. Is that correct?  I can help you with that. I see that neither of your lines is on a Device Payment Plan, nor are they out of contract. With that in mind, you would still have $40 line access fees on each device.   However, we can still bump up your data for an additional $10/month.  That's correct. You may have an early upgrade available before that. Do you have some time right now to look over your bill for other possible savings?  Excellent. Please bear in mind that all-new plans will be available tomorrow. I would not be able to give you a detailed analysis on that for any savings, as discounts have not been finalized.  After looking over your account, I see that you are using almost all your data, so I would not recommend lowering your data plan. However, I do not see an employee discount on your account. Who is your employer?  Yes, please. I would appreciate as much information as you can give me.   Thank you for that. Please allow me to run a search for them.   I do not see a profile for them. If you are interested in possible discounts, I recommend you contact your HR department. They would be able to set you up.   Otherwise, I see nothing in your account to discount. The good news is that you are using everything you are paying for.  Do you have any further questions or concerns I may assist you with?

I can certainly understand why needing to increase your data is of importance to you. I know I would not want to go over my data as overages can be costly. What I can do for you today is access your account to see what plan is best for you.    Yes it does.   yes   Hold the mouse over my verizon   Then over my device   Sorry over manage my verizon .  Then over my verizon  Do you see view usage  Select it please.  That is where most of the data is used it's not detailed information .   The next plan is 15 gb for $100   That is 5 more gb for only $20  Instead of $15 per gb .   15 gb for $80? That's online now.  With the discount the plan is $80! for you    You can or I can complete it now if you like?  Great ! I hope you enjoy the discount on that plan .  :)   It has been our absolute pleasure assisting you and making sure you get the optimal value out of your Verizon services. Before we end, were we able to exceed your expectations and address all your needs today?  Thank you for chatting with me today, and thank you for choosing Verizon Wireless!||@Is there anyway we can add data just for this month?  Yes, is there anyway to just add additional data for this month?  Well we are normally good at staying under, but my one daughter has a harder time staying within her limit. Do you know if snap chat uses a lot of data?  is there anyway to go into our account and see if that's what taking up all of her data usage or will it just tell you it is an app? Also are we better off adding data to our plan this month and reducing it back to ten next month or do we have to pay the overage for this month?  and then?  I am not finding it  yes  I saw her data usage before but it only says Web & Apps as the most. Is there anyway to see which specific app?  alright thank you I will look into it more. Now back to my original question sorry for going off in  a different direction. Is it possible to just up our data for this month or once we change it, is it that way for months to come as well.  Yeah that makes sense.....during our next billing cycle are we able to change back to ten  I thought I saw a deal too where the 15gb is $80?  yeah is it possible to do that  thank you that would be great do  i just go online to change it  I think I already did but can you go and check to make sure it was the $80 for 15GB plan  I will for sure and hopefully we won't have to worry about going over nextt month  Yes you were great help thank ou for everything||@

Thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless Sales Chat. I am here to provide you with outstanding service. Who do I have the pleasure of chatting with today?   It's nice to meet you, Amy! I will be happy to answer your questions regarding the monthly access fees.  I want to review your account. Will that be ok with you?   In order to pull up your account, please provide me with your first and last name and your 10-digit Verizon Wireless phone number.   Thank you, Amy. For your security, please provide me with the billing system password (which is a maximum of five alphanumeric digits/letters).   Please allow me one moment to research that information for you.   The password you provided was correct.  Please allow me a moment to review your account.  You have two lines on your account.   I am here  The account that is out of contract should have a discount for month to month service.   You will need to contact customer service to activate that discount.  The line that is still under contract will still have the $40 monthly access charge.   No it is a charge applied for having data.  You are correct.  Everyone that is on the MORE Everything plan receives this charge.  Is there anything else I can help you with this evening?  Thank you for chatting with Verizon Wireless Sales Chat. Have an outstanding day!||@Amy Meyer.  Each of my phones has a $40 monthly access fee  what exactly is this?  thats fine  Amy Meyer 904-874-5195  no idea  could be bogey  hello?  i know that  I am trying to actually get a new phone and put it on to a contract.  At this point in time, can you just tell me what the access charge is?  Is it a charge for being under contract?  so everyone who has data has a $40 charge on top of their data allowance?  thanks  no I'm good||@

Thanks for chatting with me on today! I can understand those concerns, as I am seeing that the line is active at this time.  Should it not be?   I am showing that both the 7800 and 9662 lines are active and using data at this time. Are you wanting to suspend services on the 9662 line at this time?   I am also showing minute usage and text usage on the line in this cycle as well. May I ask who the device and line belongs to?  I am showing that the line has been on your account since 10/22/14. Did you not add this line unto your account?   Actually, the line was added on 9/21/14. Sorry for that confusion.  I understand, and thanks for that  info. I am showing that you did have the line suspended for some time. However, the line has been reactivated and is now in use. Did you give another family member the line?   I understand what you mean, as I would agree. I would recommend contacting that line and seeing who is using it, and if it is fraud or someone that you have not given permission to use services on your account, you would be able to contact our fraud department at888-483-7200 and have that additional line and its charges removed from your account and that reviewed as well.   AWesome! That will work. Also, I am not sure why you would not have received an answer previously. Mon - Sat, 8 AM - 8 PM Local Time (ET, CT, MT, PT zones) are the hours for that department as well  No problem, the pleasure is mine. ALso, while I have you connected, may I ask how your overall experience has been with Verizon so far?   Hey just checking in on you. Are you still with me? I just wanted to check in to make sure everything is going okay with our connection, as I'm still here to assist if you like.  No problem! Thanks for your response! That is great! I am glad that you are enjoying services! We will definitely continue to strive to make those experiences and our services remarkable for you as we definitely appreciate your decision in making us your service provider! Need anything else from  me? I don't mind.   I am not sure why that would be happening. However, you are able to contact customer care phone reps at 800-922-0204 and request to be transferred to fraud reps.   Awesome! I am glad I was able to provide you with that info to help as the pleasure is mine. Enjoy your evening!       Thank you for your time, as it was my pleasure to assist you, and thanks again for being a part of the Verizon family.

That is not good:(   Real quick, may I have your mobile number  thank you   I see you just got the phone on the 6th. You are still on the 14 day return period.

If you do not mind me asking, how has your overall Verizon Wireless Experience been for you?   I see that you have gone over your data usage for this month. did you want me to move you up to a high plan for this month to avoid overage  Real quick  the overage is going to be $15.00 and to change your plan is $10.00  I can set this up for you and get you back on the original plan at the start of the next cycle.   okay, no problem   I want to make sure I have resolved all of your concerns. Have I done that for you?||@I upgraded my phone and got it last Thursday there is a problem with the call feature  It sounds like the speaker is blown when people talk or calls go out and it mutes my voice to others in the middle of a conversation  7576925443  can you check the stock in the local store to see if they have it? greenbrier store?  ok i will visit them tomorrow i am sure they can refer me if they are out or order one. thank you  fine great coverage we have been with verizon over 10 years  no i will pay the overage this time it was a 1 time occurance we have never gone over in the past and we know what put us over thank you though  no i am good thank you though  you did thank you||@

They have a Verizon discount that is 19% off the monthly plan according to their info. They also say a free phone is the other discount. I was wondering if the free phone is also applicable with the new Verizon plan (no 2yr contract)  So if I were to get a plan with the new no-contract, what would be the cost? Assuming that I get a Samsung Galaxy s6 32GB and do a 3GB/month plan? Including the company discounts  Monthly cost that is  Ok thank you  I've had samsung phones for the past two phones and have been very happy. Most recently the galaxy s4  Yea, those are all reasons why I'm looking into that one. Thanks again for your help.  I'm not going to do that today. I'm on another verizon plan now, and looking to see if it is financially beneficial to switch. If I am the only line, would the 3GB be the most cost-effective if I use a little over 2GB/month? The reason I ask is that I know the line charge is $10 more/month for less GB. Also I wasn't sure if the single person line plan was still available||@

Go ahead with your question  Does the billing information match that of the credit card billing information?  Yes, it is only offered online.  It sends it to you once you receive the device, you have to complete the order first.  I completely understand your frustration, however the billing information must match that of the credit card billing information in order to process.||@hello  I have a question regarding my order checkout process  I have put in my office address for shipping, and it keeps telling me it cannot validate the address and to fix the errors.  I know my address and I know it is correct.  Now what??  actually i got that fixed.  My other question is on the $100 Visa card offer for upgrading to the LG G4.  It is an online only offer.  Do I need to check something or does it automatically send it to me?  it has not mentioned it at all during this online process.  when will it mention  it to me?  i also am trying to pay with my credit card but it is mine and a different billing address than the account.  it will not allow me to use my credit card.  I am getting very upset, I have been trying to complete one simple phone upgrade now for over 40 minutes  this is awful  very aful  awful||@

May I ask who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?  Not a problem.  The line access fees for smartphones is $40.00 per month.  With being on Edge the line access charge would then be $15.00 for that line.  Which lines are on Edge?  Ok. One moment while I take a look.  Thank you for your patience. With looking at the July invoice, I am showing that the line access charges were discounted to $15.00 per line for the 3 lines. This discount will show under Monthly charges under each line and the discount will say $25.00 SP Device Payment Disc.  This would have started when the lines where signed up under Edge. As well as the plan being on a More Everything 6gb and higher plans.  From looking at the account you have been on the More Everything 15gb plan since October 23, 2014, so the discount would have been on the lines when the lines were upgraded to Edge.  The statement will show like this with the smartphone being $40.00 and then the $25.00 discount.  Thank you for your patience. The employee discount I am showing was applied to the account on July 13, 2015, the discount can take one to three billing cycles to show on the bill.  From looking at the account on the bill statements, the only month that the employee discount was not on the bill was on your July invoice, I will have this correct to having the discount added onto this bill.||@hello  I need to know the line access fee for smartphones on the more everything plan?  With phones on edge plan? with over 6gbs of data?  okay well why have I been being charged for for 3 lines that are smartphones on the edge plan?  im being charged 40.00 each smartphone  and I have 15gbs  of data.  9795953913  9795958678  9792197755  Those 3.  and I checked my line access under charges by line  and it says that.  and it shows the 25.00 credit for having over 10 gbs  for each line.  but im wondering when this started  that its been 15.00 for a line access fee  no it would say line access fee of 15.00 , because that's what it should say, not 40.00 with a 25.00 credit because of the fact that I had over 10 gbs  so it should state that the access fee of 15.00  with a 25.00 Equip.  Ill call Verizon myself tomorrow because it should have that. and the fact that they haven't put my 16% employee discount, and include a .03% discount over the base bill which covers minutes and calling.  So that needs to be fixed because it hasn't changed for at least 3 months  Hello?  yes but it was already on.  it was verified again, so will Verizon pay the .16% on the base bill?  for 3 billing cycles ?  You know ill just call Verizon Wireless myself, Good day Sir||@

While I pull up your account, may I ask what's going on that is causing you to want to disconnect your lines?   I'm definitely sorry to hear that, Jennipher, we definitely don't want to see you go as you have been with us since 2002! I see that your 7744 line does not currently have an early termination fee, the 7787 line has a $230.00 early termination fee, 8687 is $350.00, and 2622 is $175.00.  What kind of phone is it, if I may ask? Perhaps I can check to see if we have it available to you.   Let me take a look here right quick!   Jennipher, I do see that your line ending in 7744 is eligible for an upgrade, however, we do not currently have that device in our stock. You may be able to purchase it unlocked and transfer it on to this line, if you like, though!   I definitely understand where you're coming from, Jennipher! We're more than happy to look through our stock and find a device that you may like even more in the long run, if you choose to do that! Did you have any other questions for me at this time?

Ok currently the 7641 number is listed as the owner so you can log in under the 7641 number and view which lines are eligible for an upgrade.  It should be the same.||@Hello. Having difficulty with managing my family plan.  they just had to reset my password and know I'm in, but can't see what phones can be upgraded.  the # i'm signed in under is 973 975 7640  sure  how can I switch the account owner from 7641.  ??  ok, so you want me to close out the 7640 and sign in under 7641?  7640  ok; that is what I'll do.

That is an excellent question! May I ask with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?  It's a pleasure to be assisting you Wendy! Now, to answer your question, no, he does not have to upgrade, nor change his plan  However when he does upgrade, his plan would have to be changed to our new plans  The new policies are more towards new customers really  Yes, that is correct?  I apologize Wendy  Yes, that is correct  Hit the shift button on accident  It depends on what plan you decide  If you stayed with the 6GB plan, price will stay the same  However for $20.00 more a month, you will get 6GB of additional data  Close, you will still have 6GB of shared data  I apologize, for an additional $20.00 a month more, you will have a total of 12GB of data a month  Of course Wendy, now, if you upgrade to the ihpne 6, you will have monthly payments of $27.00, plus the price of the plan which is $80.00, plus $180.00 for the other phones access fees, bringing the total to around $287.00 per month  I'm sorry Wendy, what do you mean by G?  Ah, understood, you would get 12GB of data  that is correct Wendy  If you upgraded your phone tonight or tomorrow does not really make a huge difference. If you upgraded your phone right now, your monthly  total would be $240.00  So you would save money in the short and long run  the access fees for your phones (which total $160.00 ($40.00 per phone) plus the price of the plan which is $80.00  I believe I may have mispoken, no, your plan will stay the same, as long as you upgrade before tomorrow  Yes, that is correct Wendy  I apologize Wendy! And you are very welcome! Is there anything else I may assist you with today?  Well Wendy, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for chatting in and for being an awesome customer since 2002. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask, If not, please click ""End Chat"" button, thank you for chatting in and have a great rest of your day!||@Hi I have a question about your new plan that goes into effect tomorrow  My husband has iPhone 4 and we have a family plan with 2 other iPhones with Verizon. If he doesn't not upgrade today at the discounted rate, will he be forced to change to the new plan if he waits to upgrade after tomorrow  Wendy  So if we upgrade online tonight he can still keep the family plan for 2 more years  Will he be paying more for the new plan?  Our current plan we share 6G so the new plan each phone will have 6g  But it will cost 20.00 more per phone per month for the same 6 g  So if he waited and upgraded to iPhone 6 the cost would be monthly rate of 650 divided into 24 months so about 27.00 + 20 any other charges.  Or can you give me a breakdown  For the least G plan  Wow we currently pay 188.00 a month so another 100.00 with new plan . And how many G do we get for 3 phones?  Gigabyte?  For 3 phones to share?  So we should  upgrade his phone tonight to save 100.00 a month for 2 more years if we are not concerned about the gigabyte increase  What does the 240 include?  If he upgrades his phone then all phones are automatically changed to new plan also?  So just to clarify. If we upgrade one phone tonight to iPhone 6 the family plan on all 3 phones stay the same ? Even the new upgraddd phone.  Ok thank you . Soo confusing .  No that is all thanks again||@

Can I get your first and last name please?  Thank you Inna!  What questions did you have today?  Do you see the dates next to the charges?  The plans are monthly plans, when you are done with the plan you can chat or call in to remove that or you can do so online on your MyVerizon  Would you like me to remove that plan for you?  No problem! Just a moment please and I can do that  Go ahead  It'll take me a minute to remove the plans  You're welcome!  Go ahead and ask the questions- I can do two things at once (usually!)  Are you saying that you did not go to those countries?  That would be the number of minutes used while in those countries, both incoming and outgoing  So you had a 100 minute total allowance, and the charge is for the number of minutes used over that allowance  Does that make sense?  I've gone ahead and removed those plans, by the way, so your next bill is going to have a refund for those on it- it's going to be smaller than usuall  *usual  No problem!  If you want to add or delete international features in the future, you can do that on your MyVerizon  I understand, just a moment please  There's also a specific international customer service number you can dial whilst abroad   Conversation transferred due to agent disconnect  Hey! Thank you for coming to Verizon chat today!  Great! Please give me a moment to pull up your bill Inna.   Thank you! What did you want to talk about on this bill Inna?  I will be glad to check on that Inna.  Inna I was able to see that the 461 was not for the countries but for the amount of data that was used.   Yes, was there anything else that I can do for you?  It was great working with you today Inna! Again, my name is Alejandro and I am glad I was able to resolve all your issues today. We appreciate your time as a loyal customer since 2009 at Verizon! Thank you again for coming into chat today. When you are ready please hit ""END CHAT,"" at the top right hand side of this window.Have a great rest of your day!||@Hello, I have some questions about my bill  yes, Inna Kunz. The questions also apply to my husband James' bill too  regarding the $40 Global data package--it shows up under ""new plan"" as well as ""month in advance"" ...does that mean I was charged twice?  I did not ask for it to be applied to my August pay period  the Month in Advance one says 08/09 - 09/08  yes please, for both lines  thank you  my other question relates to the Global package as well  thanks!  just tell me when you're ready  ha, that's better than me!  so I understood about my minutes/text/data allowance, but I seem to have incurred extra charges on countries which I don't understand. It looks like this:  Countries Included in Plan global MB 100 461  we did go to the countries, but I don't understand why it counted 111 for Germany, for example, and 35 for Switzerland.  not really, because there's a separate minute thing and there's no way we spoke on the phone this much  thanks!!  I'm seeing tons of minutes on the 8135 line and my husband hardly ever used the phone  oh good to know! If only Verizon Online worked better overseas  If it helps, on the bill it has "" global roam min 100 37 "" and then the Countries part is separate  hello, thanks for helping me!  I have a question regarding my latest bill  My husband and I both had the $40 Global package on our lines, and I understand it had 100 minutes, 100 texts, and 100mg of data, but I see something about a limit of 100 countries. The bill says I used 461 Countries...which is obviously confusing. Could you explain this to me please?  ooooooh that makes much more sense  no, that was it. Thanks!  Have a good night||@

We no longer offer Unlimited data tho. However, on our prepaid side we have two plans for smart phones. We have the $45 with 1GB and if you set up autopay, you will get 1GB extra. That will bring your data up to 2GB monthly for $45. We also have the $60 with 2.5GB plus autopay that will be 3.5GB.  I do understand they do have unlimited data. However, it won't be the same coverage tho.   They  use our towers.   It may be the case where you move from one place to another and the coverage might be interrupted.||@Crystal  I'm actually just curious. I've been with Verizon Prepaid for a while now and I'm actually thinking about leaving it. Is there anything yall are doing to compete with the other services offered?  It's just disheartening when I can get unlimited talk, text, and DATA at straight talk for $45 a month when I get 3 gigs of data here for $60 a month  I'd prefer to stay with Verizon, I just eed something more economical  That's still so much more for less service||@

Please allow me one moment please to get your account pulled up.  I am showing that you are on the 20GB data allowance, but since the 20GB data allowance was made effective in the middle of your billing cycle the data allowance prorated only giving you 7.097GB to use.   I am showing that you have used 8.150GB out of the 7.097GB data allowance.   That is correct, the overages would have been taken care of if the plan would have been backdated to start at the beginning of the current billing cycle.   Allow me one moment please and I will see if I am able to reverse the changes.   I would suggest the Family Base feature to limit usage on the lines. Verizon FamilyBase, previously Usage Controls, is a service that allows you to monitor and control  phone usage, including: calls, text, picture and video messages, data, contacts and app usage. The Family Base feature would be free the firs 30 days after the 30-day trial the Family Base feature would be $4.99/per month.    I have tried to reverse the changes but it is not allowing me to do so, I would only be able to increase the data allowance up to the next allowance available.   You are currently on the 20GB data allowance, I have tried to reverse the changes to backdate the 20GB data allowance, but it is not allowing me to do so. The next allowance up would be the 30GB data allowance for $225.00.   I just wanted to check in to make sure everything is going okay. I'm still here to assist if you like.  If you do not change the data allowance you will be charged the overage fee. The overage fee is $15.00/per every additional 1GB that you go over.||@looking at my options for data.  Had unusual activity this month.  How much of 20 gb is left.  would i have been better off to start it at the beginning of the billing cycle?  when i looked at the usage categories there was a lot of web and video, is there a way to control the video activity?  Can you make that change, that is what I thought iwas doing.  how about making the change to start the data usage to 20 gb  what is the next incremental charge?  i just completed the change to family base.  If i do nothing now what will happen from a billing stanpoint.  ok||@

We can leave the plan as is due to the bill cycle ending on tonight.   I completely understand that your bill cycle ends today and will restart on tomorrow. We can leave your plan as is and not make any changes to your plan regarding increasing the data. I do understand everything that you are saying by not wanting to make any changes to your plan.  If there is any overage before the bill cycle ends, there will be a charge of $15.||@My data just reached its max. My plan ends in 3 hours. Any way I won't be charged $15 for more?  paying $15 for 3 more hours is not really something I want to do.  wayne marquardt  I am already paying way too much for data. It is my only internet access at this time  i believe my plan will actually stop in 2 hours  ok  I have to use the jetpack for internet  I am looking for an internet provider where I live, but the options are very minimal  I have 2 hours left in this months plan. I do not want to pay for more at this minute  I am just working and need the internet to send my report in two hours. I will not need it for anything else, and it will start over in 2 hours  increasing to a different plan is not an optio  not understanding what you are saying  I am not using the internet anymore tonight.  so it won't charge me $15?  I am not even going to get on the internet after we chat  I will wait until morning to get back on, after my new cycle starts  goodnight||@

Thank you for coming to Verizon chat today!  I will be happy to look into that.  Barbara I was able to see that it is suspended however it is suspended with billing.  Barbara did you suspend the line or did you call in or come to chat to suspend it?  It was suspended on 06/11/2015. You can always take it off suspend and suspend it with out billing.   I do see that you have been a loyal Verizon customer since 2002, what we can do is credit the $21.41 charge from the last bill.   You would need to go to your My Verizon and connect the phone then you can suspend it with billing.  You will not be billed for it Barbara, I was also able to add the credit to your account.   When you are on your My Verizon scroll down to My devices from there click on the suspended line and have it reconnect.  When you are on your My Verizon scroll down to My devices from there click on the suspended line and have it reconnect.  I know Barbara, however you will then be re-suspending it and you would then do it with out billing.   It was great working with you today Barbara! Again, my name is Alejandro and I am glad I was able to resolve all your issues today. We appreciate your time as a loyal customer since 2002 at Verizon! Thank you again for coming into chat today. When you are ready please hit ""END CHAT,"" at the top right hand side of this window.Have a great rest of your day!||@I need to find out why I am billed for my Wi-Fi that has been suspended.  I have not been able to connect with it and I have misplaced it in the last few weeks.  Why with billing?  I just do not want to be charged for it so I suppose I came to chat to suspend it.  Will I still be charged for it? And how long has it been suspended with billing?  What do I need to do to take care of that? And can I be refunded for the suspended charges?  What do you mean connect the phone then suspend it with billing?  I do not want to be billed for a suspended Wi-Fi.  Thank you.  Now, what do I need to do  I do not want it reconnected.  As I said I have lost the device and have never been able to connect to the internet in Virginia with it.  OK Thanks very much.  I  will do that  Have a good evening||@

Would you like to continue chatting?  What can I assist you with today?  Oh no! No worries though! :) I am an expert on the MyVerizon website, I would love to work together with you to get you logged into your account today, but first I need to ask you a few questions :). Could you please give me your 10 digit mobile device number and full name? By the way, how is your day going so far?  Thank you again! Glad to hear that you are having a pretty good day though hopefully we can help it improve :)  My day is going well thank you for asking   Thank you for that number! Could I have your name to accompany that number please?  Thank you Faith!   Thank you so much for that information. In order to verify you on the account as an authorized user, could I please have your 3-5 character billing password? If you do not know it, I can instead verify the last 4 of your account owner's SSN.  vThank you for verifying that last 4 with me! We just have one more step to go!! I am going to be sending your phone a text message that will be including a random 6 digit number. When you receive the text, tell me the number that I sent and we will be good to go!  Has that text come through yet?  Awesome! Let me look over that online account for a moment to see what's going on. While I do that let's get your billing password reset.  I can easily help you get your billing password reset today. This password needs to be between 3-5 characters. These letters are not case sensitive, and may only contain letters and numbers.What would you like it to be?  How's it going? It's been a while since I last heard from you just checking in :)  Awesome! I have that updated and there will be a notification text coming shortly to you for that update :)  Online I am seeing we would need to get you registered so that you could have an online password and suer id   user*  REGISTER HERE  ^Click the above link^  Follow it's prompts. It has a lot of the explaining done but if you run into any issues or speed bumps on the way I am here to help :)  No problem! Were you able to get registered?  That is what we updated earlier:)  No worries :)  Hey just wanted to make sure that you are still there. Didn't get abducted by aliens on me did you? :)  I'm here to help if you need any. :)  Woo!! Glad that you weren't abducted :)  Based on this chat session with me, would you recommend Verizon Wireless to friends and family?  Glad to hear that you would and it is the data that I am seeing that caused that. I can provide you a number you can go over and see if we have any plans that better suit your usage.   Okay I understand Yes each gb over is $15 then you had month in advance for the new plan just to cover if you left us so that you don't have to worry about the final bill.   But $30 of that was overage  It is only charged that first month now you will be looking at the $80 unless you go over.   cThank you for using Verizon Wireless chat! Happy to get you pointed in the right direction on that online account! Go ahead and close out of the chat when you're ready to :)||@yes please  i need to find out the password and username for my account online  4049873442 and it could be better but i'm doing pretty good for now! thank you, how about you?  thanks Zach! you are making it better as we speak.

You can absolutely purchase a certified phone and you have the option to change your plan whenever you need to.  :)  Are you interested in moving over to our New Price Plan?  I totally understand.  How much data do you think you would need?  You are correct.   I see a 20% discount that we can apply towards your monthly access charge.  Then you'll get the 6GB for only $48.  Then, one line will be $40 since it's still within contract.  Another line will be $20.  That'll be $108 before taxes.  Yes, Melaney.  Certainly!  The new pricing offers a lower base charge.  Absolutely!  Let me provide you the breakdown of charges.  You're most welcome.  For More Everything 6GB - account acces is $70 then 20% discount will be added.  Then line ending 4364 will be $15.  Line ending 3032 will be $15 if not within a 2-year contract renewal.  It's less expensive if you get the month to month discount and/or device payment discount of $25 for each line.  Yes, you are correct.  The difference with the New Pricing is that the Verizon Plan 6GB is only $60. Then both lines can get $20 line access charge.  The standard line access charge for More Everything is $40.  You only get it for $15 because of the $25 discount added on the line.  For More Everything, the account access will be $70 minus 20%, so that's $56.  The $48 discounted account access is for the new pricing for our new Verizon Plan.  Yes, it will be for the current plan offers.  Tomorrow, we will be launching our new pricing.  I recommend you also check our new price plan so as to save more when you upgrade.  Definitely! I highly recommend doing that so you can get cheaper pricing.  You're most welcome. I have just added a note on your account regarding this concern.  :)  If you ever find the need to chat with us again, I hope I'm lucky enough to assist you again.  My pleasure.

I would be moving both lines to the new plan  could you give me a break down of both lines on the anything plan? I though it would be the $48 plus $15 a month for each phone line  thanks  you said above that ""Then, one line will be $40 since it's still within contract"" what is that for?  so I will have $48 6GB charge, and a $15 charge for 3032 after discount, and $15 charge for 4364 after the discount.  ah, so that is for my current plan?  ok thank you. so I should buy my phone and upgrade my plan at the same time to save more?  awesome thank you for your help!  thank you!||@

What we could do just to make sure it also had a password. Because the way it is set up now, all shed have to know is the last 4 of your social. So if we set a 5 character password, she wouldnt be able to get in at all.  It can be letters, numbers or both but only up to 5  perfect! thats okay, you would just need to know the last four of your social. Very simple fix  Trust me, I totally get what your saying. Actually I already thought that out for you. She cant even open your account at all because shes not named on the account. The reason why I even added the password is because if she tried on chat, shed have to enter the password. Since she doesnt know it, they will disconnect. So you are all set  Anytime. I just rid of my former gf so I completely understand   Did you have any other questions for me?  Sure go ahead  Well you can call 866-456-7892 and it will walk you through it or you can do it online on www.verizonwireless.com/renewdiscount  Ok well, I appreciate you taking the time to chat in and want to thank you for being apart of the Verizon Family.

If you click END CHAT, you can receive a transcript of our current conversation for your own records.    Anytime Mark||@Mark Chronister  Mkay. Wait a sec while I type it out, please.  My wife is seeking a divorce. As such, she wants her own phone and asked that I release her number. I would like to do that at this time.  Please release phone 405-816-0214 from my plan and tranfer all responsability to her  Her name is Rebecca Chronister. May be asking under her maiden name Rebecca Ingle.  She gave me a direct number of 888-832-4540. When I called it sounded like I was the one who was going to assume the responsability rather than the other way around.  Gotcha. I will have her call that number. I appreciate your help. Which brings me to my next request.....  On this account. My account, for 405-474-6555. I wish all her authority and priveleges revoked. Moreso it is imperative that she can, in no way, access this account. Not hiding anything but I don't want her anywhere near it.  Problem is, she knows all of my info. For all I know, she could be the one actually typing this. See what I mean?  Gotcha......  73102  What if I forget it? Heh.  Don't have my little black book of passwords handy...  Gotcha.......still makes it easy but I understand you can't save me from my own stupidity and forgetfulness.  Anyway to note the account, 'no female voice at all, even if they have passwords'?  At least, for now?  Not trying to be difficult. But I gotta look out for myself from here on out.  Anthony, you are a schemer of the highest order. Thank you for your help and assistance!  I appreciate the understanding.  Nope.  Unless you know a good divorce attorney.  But you took matters into your own hands.  I appreciate the help and all.  Wait.  One more thing.  I get a discount for my work. Got a letter saing I need to renew the discount. Can I do that here and now?  Cool, cool, cool.  Whelp, that oughta do it.  Most personable chat person I have ever spoken with. And that counts for a lot.  Good luck out there.||@

I did look into this for you and you will see the $40 credit on your account.  The $40 credit will be on the upcoming bill as it is an unbilled credit.||@I keep getting disconnected. I've had an upgrade available since october on my 6903 line and I added a line to my account 2 days ago; for some reason, the upgrade got transferred to and is showing eligible on the new line. Is there any way that you can switch it back to the 6903 line that it is supposed to be on  .  It's ok. Just want to get it corrected  When i added the 3626 line it charged me an upgrade fee, but it was a new line not an upgrade, i was told that i would receive a credit and it would be reflected in 2-3 hours and the amount due was $140.80. I went to pay my bill but am still showing $144.80. Can you check that first?  Nick Coombs  Thank you  So is my current balance 104.80 that I need to pay or is the $40 credit on the next bill?  Ok. thank you for the info. I can use the website to upgrade the 3626 line and then swap them so the new phone is on the 6903 line||@

Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?  Hello! Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?  Okay allow me just a moment to get your account pulled up for review.  What can I help you with today Garo?  Absolutely! I can definitely help you with that today. Allow me a moment to review your bill.  On your current bill, I'm seeing that your monthly charges are $125.00 before taxes and surcharges. Line ending in 5875 has a device payment of $31.24. Line ending in 7846 has a device payment of $35.41. Line ending in 7849 has a device payment of $31.24. Those device payments equal out to $97.89.   So, other than your normal monthly charges, those are the only other charges on your bill other than taxes and surcharges for your current bill.  The previous bill had some credits applied to it which made it cheaper than normal.  Just a moment.  Your June 08, 2015 bill was $248.47. The 3 $100.00 Costco credits were applied towards that bill which left you a bill due of $0.00 for that month. You then had a credit of $51.53 left over on your account which went toward your August 08, 2015 bill. That brought your balance down to from $234.89 to $183.36 due.  Let me take a look at you guys usage and see if there is a different plan that would better fit your budget and needs.  Allow me just another moment.  I'm seeing in June you guys used around 1.21 GB of data. In July you guys used around 3.13 GB of data. So if this is what you guys are normally using you can definitely go to a lower data plan and save some money. Right now you have 10 GB of data that you are hardly using.  I can definitely understand. They put the credit towards your account instead of putting it on gift cards. So, we have no control of that. I apologize that they did it differently that what they informed you of. Currently you are paying $80.00 for the MORE Everything Unlimited Talk and Text with 10 GB of data. If you move to the MORE Everything Unlimited Talk and Text with 6 GB of data it would be $70.00. If you move to the MORE Everything Unlimited Talk and Text with 4 GB of data it would be $60.00.  I would recommend moving to the 4 GB of data if, at the most, you guys are only using 3 GB.  What do you think?  I can definitely understand and I agree completely. However, we can not do anything about that. You would have to go back to the store where this took place to get that issue resolved. Yes, your September bill should be around $235.00. Garo, I just want you to know that I can definitely relate to your situation. The credits were applied to your bill and I apologize once again that they did not put those on gift cards as they promised. I just want to personally thank you for your loyalty to Verizon.  Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today Garo?  Absolutely. Thank you for chatting in with me today Garo.  It has been a pleasure chatting with you today. We here at Verizon value you as a customer! Again, my name is Jessica. Please do not hesitate to ask questions. I am here to help. Please click the ""END CHAT"" button to end this chat session.

May I ask who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?  I will gladly take a look into that for you! How has the rest of your day been going?  Yes, the discount it is referring to is your employee discount. You are periodically required to revalidate the discount. You can do this through the Verizon website, or with our employee validation department. I can provide you with a link on our website, or their telephone number.  I do definitely understand! Does she have a work email? You can validate with that too. The first revalidation message was sent back on 6/20. Worst case scenario a rep should be able to credit you the discount if it comes to this. I will leave a note informing any future reps, too.   Do you think she would be able to get this information before 9/20?  I do apologize, but there is not a way to actually change the date. It is very possible you can work out an agreement with our employee validation team, and inform them of the issue you are having. They may very well be able to work out an extension. I will also leave a note on your account that we can honour the employee discount for the next billing cycle.   Yes, it would need to be a manual credit, unless you work something out with our employee team. I would highly suggest contacting them, if only for notation. The credit would need to be added by Customer Care. I can give you their number too.   You will receive an option to speak with them at 800-922-020. I will also make notes of what I have advised you. Just one more moment, please.  Okay! The notation has been left. Did you have anything else you'd like me to look into?  Oh my mistake! 800-922-0204.  No problem! Have a great night.

Ok, I can understand the frustration about not being able to get the device. I am looking in to all the resources to see how we may be of help!  We can ensure that you that it has not been stolen. I am so sorry about all this but since Fedex has requested another day for shipment we can not change this. We do not have a way to push the delivery for you. I am so sorry about all this. All we can do is recommend what for the device. Also for the package they do have a signature that has been request so the device would not be able to be activated with out this.  From what we can see the package is going to be delivered at 10Am. Now if it does not  then would would help you by filling out a lost or stolen request to have the device replaced for you.||@My order of an iPhone 6 was supposed to be delivered today. It has been sitting at FEDEX 7 miles from my house since yesterday morning and they can't get it delivered. I've contacted their chat and they sent me to their 800 number. Useless. What can you do to get my phone to me ASAP?  They said the local FEDEX office requested another day to deliver it. I'm not sure I believe they will deliver it tomorrow.  Please know that there is always someone here to accept delivery - but they haven't even attempted delivery.  Thank you - my concern is that it has been stolen.  What if it doesn't arrive tomorrow?  OK Thanks||@

I was able to verify that your data feature of 1GB for $10.00 was added to your account successfully.

Would you like me to walk you through the simple steps to process your payment?  Sure, you only need to access your online account and process a payment of $10.00 with the add funds link.  In the amount box, you only need to enter the number 10 since the system only accepts whole numbers.  You can also dial *611 or #768 to process the payment but, please be sure to process it as a payment instead of adding more data.  Yes, that is correct Sandy.  Always glad to help!

My name is Bert Cook & I recently signed up for the free 1 month trial of Family Locator & now I want to remove it from my account. I don't really care for it.  Is there a way I can do this online in my verizonwireless acct login or do I have to have Verizon remove it.  I am great & thanks for asking. How are you?  Awesome & congrats to everyone involved.  Overall I can't really complain about my service with Verizon. Like with all my other bills I wish it were lower but that's life. :)  Ok great.  No problem.  No problem Rizal & your welcome.  No sir unless you found a way to safe me a few $$$ a month on my bill.  Ok. I do already get a Veterans discount so I'm not sure you can offer me anything more.  That sounds awesome. Is that a one time discount or is that a monthly discount for a limited time?  Ok so I will be saving an additional $25 a month on top of my Veterans discount up until the time I upgrade my device?  That is awesome & a heck of a lot more than I could have anticipated. Thank you Rizal. Just to make sure I understand correctly once I upgrade my phone my bill will go back to what I'm currently paying correct?  Also does the phone upgrade only apply to my line or any line on the acct?  Ok great & thanks. This will not affect my Veterans discount in anyway now or once I upgrade correct?  No sir. You have been an amazing help today & gone above beyond the call of duty in my opinion Rizal. Thank you very much again for your time professionalism & assistance with me today.

Thank you. I am going to do everything in my best ability to get this fixed for you today.  I am still looking for ways you can decrease your monthly bill.  You are more than welcome Angel.  What I can do is offer you the 4GB plan for $50.00 a month or a extra 2GB bonus data for 1 year.  The 2GB is free for 12 months.  You bill will be the same, this is just a extra free 2GB.  That is one of your offers.  You can do the 4GB for $50.00 which is $10.00 less than what you are paying now.  I see that you have a employee discount that you have not validated yet. That can make a big difference as well.   You have it, you just haven't validated it yet. You can go to VerizonWireless.com/discounts and validate it.  Currently you are not getting the discount because you have not validated that yet. When you validate it, it will appear on your bill and make a big difference in what you were paying for your data plan.  Awesome. I am going to do that right now.  You are more than welcome Angel.  I hope that you do the same. Thank you for being the best part of Verizon. I hope that you have a wonderful rest of the evening. Again my name is Celeste. Have a good day!  When you are ready to say goodbye to me, you can click the ""END CHAT"" button.||@What can I do to manage my bill to make it not so expensive?

Okay, I will look into that for you. Which line did you cancel?  Okay  When did you contact us to cancel that line?  Okay, I do not see mention of that at this time. Did they discuss your early termination fee for that line?  $180.00  One moment.  That is because your plan will not change until August 20th. Per policy.  Yes, that is correct, your plan will not change until that time. As far as the cancelation, you are in contract on that line until February 17th, 2016. I do not have the ability to change contract end dates or waive early termination fees. There was no disconnect order placed.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?||@Teri  I just changed my plan and was told after canceling one of my lines my bill would be 187.00.  I just received an email stating my bill would be 240.00 and it did not look like the line was canceled.  ending in 6865  today thru chat - when I changed my plan.  no - how much is that?  mmm - seems like she should have mentioned that.  Also, why did she say my bill would only be 187 instead of 240?  Ok - so then it will be 187?  I also think I should get to cancel with no termination fee as she did not mention it to me.  So does this mean I will not have unlimited talk until august 20th?  Ok - thank you||@

I would be more than happy to pull up your bill with you and review it. I would be concerned as well if it were higher than what it normally is. Please allow me 1-2 minutes to review your bill, then we can walk through it together.  No worries  Ok the reason why you didn't get the Employee discount  is because of the type of plan that you are on.  See since you are on a discount single line plan it wont allow us to give you double the discount on a single line plan.  Now if you were on our share plan then you can your employer discount.  But you will only be saying a $5 difference  between the single plans your on now and the share plan with the discount .   Thank you for being the best part of verizon. You are truly value you as a customer with us.At this time press the ""End Chat"" button to receive your transcript of your chat. Please be safe and have a wonderful day and a even better week.||@I got a notification that I was approved for a monthly discount on my bill for my employment that I have received in the past & recently renewed but the discount is not on my bill & it shows 0%.  Ok...sounds good. Thank you.  Oh...ok. That makes sense now. Thank you so much for checking on it for me. I appreciate it. Have a good night!||@

We got access to the account.  Please allow me a moment to review your plan information.  Brandon, reviewing the account, I see that the account activated a 3GB data packaged with your $45.00 payment. This second data package was on your account waiting for a payment of $20.00 or more.  As the plan could not be renewed, the account started paying per minute and text.  Brandon, I am very sorry that you are having this issue with your business phone. Lets get this situation resolved.  Please allow me to provide you the information available at this end.  On 07/23/15, your account was added a $20.00 data package of 3GB of data and it receive the payment on 07/29/15.  When the payment was made on 07/29/15 over the phone, a second data package of 3GB was added to the account but the account did not receive a second payment for the data.  The second data package was pending for a payment until your payment on 08/11/15 was made.  Brandon, we can further assist you to activate your phone if you can contact us over the phone.

How can I help?  I see, that is not good if you can not see it. Let me access the account!  Thank you for adding the new line and continuing with Verizon!  Just a question James, do you know the mobile number to this new line?  Perfect! If it is ok with you, I am going to see if I can locate the chat, that ok?  Thank you for that! Bear with me a moment.   Was this on the 4th or 7th? Do you remember?  Thank you! One moment while I skim it.   Does 7322368169 sound familiar?  Ah ok! Thank you!   Ok, I see it now. 9122708911? That the correct one?  Ok, I see why it is not on the same account. This number is listed as being on prepaid. As is it prepaid, it will not be on the same account as your monthly one, if that makes sense.  Hmmm.. was this added at a store?   Ok, this will take me a few moments as I do not have access to prepaid.   Let me see what I can do to get it corrected.   Hope your trip went well though!  I hear you! What city were you in?  Ah ok! Sounds like fun!   Nice! It would take me a moment to get all the steps. You want the same number, yes?  Ok, let me see what I can find out! Thanks for your patience!  You are most welcome!  James, you have the device already, correct?  Ah ok! So it is not active, correct? Or has your family activated it?  Ok, now I see what is going on. As it has not activated, it will not show up on the account just yet. Is it possible to have someone try or you want to wait?  As this is an iPhone, just following the prompts.   But if you want to wait, and you activate it and it is prepaid, we can get that immediately moved, if that makes sense,  No, we have different plans. Kind of like the one you have now with just a monthly fee.   The difference is with prepaid, you have a limit, once you reach you it, no service. You on the other hand can change it or add more.   I hear you! If the device is in prepay, we can move it and it will be part of your plan, if that makes sense.   Your bill will not be affected only until it is added and then it will be a new line access.  As your plan will stay the same.   No, the 4194 is still on the More Everything 10GB plan, that is the right one, yes?  If it is added to pre-paid, I can look into it to see it is corrected, that ok?  I hear you!   Ok, what would be the best way to reach you or someone who I can contact regarding this line?  Thank you! Let me send you a test email now so you can have my info to let me know once it is active, that ok?  I totally understand and that is why I am going to make sure it is added correctly. We do not want to lose you so I will see to it that it does!   Let me send you an email so that you have my info if you need anything.   No worries! I sent you my info so if you need anything, you can reach out to me.   Got your email!   I will follow up on the account and I have been speaking to my sup so he is aware of what I have to do,   Awesome! If she needs any help, she can reach out to us or me.   You are welcome!  Any other help I can offer?  Have a great few more days and enjoy your morning!  It was a pleasure assisting you. I want to thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless. My goal is to provide you with excellent customer services. I hope to have accomplished that today.

Yokosuka Navy Base.  Im NCIS  it is.  it doesn't matter.  if theres one that's easier to remember, i'll take that.  no problem at all.  thanks for helping.  yes, but it's in Texas waiting on me to arrive next Friday.  it has not been activated.  whats involved with ""activating"" the cell?  ok, i'll try to get someone to activate it. once that's done, it will show online?  and what is the ""pre-paid"" thing?  i have to pre pay all my calls?  i don't understand the whole pre-paid thing and i don't understand why this is the first time im hearing about it.  can you explain the difference between pre paid and the plan my other cell is on?  i don't like that at all.  i will want to get off the pre paid plan.  how will this affect my bill?  i want the same plan at the same price but not the limit.  when i set this up, it was for both cell phones.  so has my other cell been moved to pre pay?  i paid a huge fee to set this new plan up.  i paid close to 150.00.  when will I receive a refund?  it is, but it was supposed to be for both cell phones.  i gave up my old plan to move to this new plan.  yes please.  email.  JSuttle@NCIS.Navy.mil  you've been helpful, but this whole deal is shady.  ive been with Verizon for a long time but the past couple of times in dealing with Verizon have been terrible.  if this cannot get figured out quickly, i may have to cancel my service completely and move to another company.  i appreciate it.  ok.  it may take several minutes to get here in Japan.  ok, received and sent a reply.  please keep me updated on whats going on with this cell.  i have my sister get it turned on and follow the prompts to register.  ok thanks.  not at this time.  thanks.  thanks i'll check back in tomorrow my time if i have any questions.||@

My name is Miles, and I?m glad you reached me today. We would like to thank you for your loyalty to the Verizon family! While I review your account to get better acclimated, please tell me a few details about how I may service you today.  I'll be more than happy to answer any questions about your may you may have, Jen!  your plan*  Just give me one moment to review your account and look into your options, Jen. Which line is your ex husband on?  While I'm reviewing your account, may I ask how your overall experience with Verizon Wireless has been?  I'm happy to hear you're enjoying your service, Jen! I see the iPhone 4S that is currently activated on line 0764. I'll be more than happy to activate a different device in place of it if you have one you would like to use for this line.  The device would need to be compatible with the Verizon Wireless network as well as the sim card.   I'm showing that the line is currently under contract and not eligible to upgrade at this time. There is an early termination fee of $180 for the line.   I'm showing that line 2312 is currently on the Device Payment agreement (formerly known as Verizon Edge). There is no contract under this agreement, so no early termination fee. However, to keep the device you would have the pay the remaining device payment balance, which is $91.64.  Once the remaining balance is paid off, your monthly charge for line 2312 will be only $15/mo for the line access.   Yes, that's correct, Jen. Once the $91.64 balance is paid off, you will only pay $15/mo for line 2312.  That's okay, Jen. I apologize for any confusion, and I'll be sure to explain everything so you fully understand.  Yes, you can upgrade line 2312 to a new device and then activate the iPhone 5C on that line to line 0764.  It has been my absolute pleasure working with such an amazing customer. Before we part ways, have I addressed all of your needs to ensure exceptional service today?  I just wanted to check in to make sure everything is going okay. I'm still here to assist if you like.

Have you tried to see if they are online.   Ok. You are able to browse the web on your phone but not on wifi, correct?  Ok, if you turn it off, can you still browse?  Can you do me a favor, can you go to app management in settings and clear the cache?  Sorry, go to settings, application manager, then under the download tab, look for the cloud app.   There will be an option to clear cache.   That is correct!  See if it goes through.   Hmmm.. ok. This may be an issue with the app and not your device.   Let me see if there is anything in regards to that. Everything else works well, yes? Calls, messages and data?  Ok, thanks for verifying that!  Thank you for your patience, not seeing anything on my end regarding the cloud but I know some users were having issues with it recently as it updated.   You have not gotten an update, have you?  Hmmm... ok. I know there is a new one that is getting pushed out. One moment, I am going to try to update it on one of our devices, ok?  Thank you for your patience, I was able to do the backup successfully on my end.   This is what I can do, I can have our network team look to see what is going on, what is preventing you from backing up.  This is the first time it failed, yes?  Ah ok! Hmmmm...odd that is shows me an update for yesterday.   Ok, what I can do is this, submit an investigation to our network team or are you ok with deleting the app and then re-adding it?   All the stuff online stays, it does not get lost as it has been backed up, if that makes sense.   Same place we went to clear cache. Settings, app management and there should be an option to uninstall.   That is ok! You can then sign in and see if it backs up.   Thank you by the way for working with me on this!  As it replaced it with the Factory Version, do you still see the app on your device?  Ok, tap on that and log in just like before.   Go through the prompts.   Still doing ok?  Ok, thank you!   Did it back up or is it still going?  Ah ok! At least no failed contacts error.   If it is backing up everything or at least checking it, yes, it can.   Let me see it I see any changes on my end.   Nothing yet on my end. Is the status bar showing you anything?  Ok, I apologize, this is going to take a while. Sorry about that.   Is there any other help or question I can answer?  I will note the account with everything we have done, if you are still having an issue, we will need to submit a network investigation. I still saw the 300+ contacts so we know that was not deleted.   Thank you for being patient through all this!   It was a pleasure assisting you. I want to thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless. My goal is to provide you with excellent customer services. I hope to have accomplished that today. Please click the end chat button to end this session and have a great night!  Then we will file an investigation with our network team. I will note the account with everything. That ok?  You can cancel it if you need your device or let it continue to see if it finishes in a bit. Totally up to you. I would let it continue though.   Yes.   Yes, please! I will note that the next step is to have an investigation open or what we call a trouble ticket.   You are most welcome!  It was a pleasure assisting you. I want to thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless. My goal is to provide you with excellent customer services. I hope to have accomplished that today.

I hate to hear the wifi connection isn't going through for you!  We can certainly take as close a look as we can into that wifi connection  What is your mobile number please?  Thanks!  Oh yeah, I totally understand how important staying in touch is. Especially since she's expecting!   Now, what wifi signal are you connected to?  Ok, what is the signal on your phone right now for bars and the data signal?  What country are you currently in?  Ah, thanks so much!  You will need to turn off airplane mode in order to text on the phone since airplane mode will disable all cellular services.   Games only need internet, they don't need a network connection to run  Hmm... Does she also have an iphone?  Ok, when you send her a text now, what happens?   Ok, since you both have iphones you have been imessaging through the wifi. Since your message says failed you can try to double tap to send as sms and let me know if that will go through  Ok, the thing with apple imessage is that is does need a cellular connection if you are using it with your mobile number.   You can also imessage using your apple id.   To get this resolved, you can turn off airplane mode then go to settings, messages and toggle imessage of and on to have it reactivate   To make sure this doesn't happen again, you can go to settings, messages, send and receive and select to use imessage with your apple id and make sure you're signed into your apple id on that same screen  Awesome!  Now, you would only have to turn airplane mode off for a moment just so you can reactivate the imessage.   If you still don't want to then I totally understand.   Then, you can use imessage through your apple id with the second set of steps listed above  What does it say now?||@Ok so I'm having trouble with my phone I'm connected to wifi and I can't send out text messages or connect to any games and when I try playing games it will connect to the game center but that is it  And I'm currently deployed right now as well  541-999-4024  I'm just trying to stay in contact with my wife who's pregnant and its very hard when I can't send her text messages  yes and it's suck I can't send her a text and I just bought my Iphone 6 plus like last month  but I know i'm connected to my mobile wifi because it go into the game center and my vpn connects  well I'm deployed right now so I don't have signal because I'm using a mobile wifi and it's a 3G wifi and it's full signal  I do have it on airplane mode as well  Kuwaite  but I'm connected to wifi I've been using it for 3 weeks that way and now it's not working  yes we both have Iphone 6 plus  it doesn't go through it says massage failed  I've tried that and it fails as well  i've tried turning my phone off and on that doesn't work i've reset my wifi that didn't work  okay I will try that  but I hae to have it on airplane mode over here because it will charge me money for being in a different country  okay I well now it wont even let me reconnect my imessaging  check connection||@

If I buy an iPhone from a company other than Verizon, can I still purchase total equipment coverage for that phone in conjunction with my verizon contract?  Thanks  My name is Tony  Thanks  Thanks!  Also, I see online that I can purchase an iPhone 5c from Verizon for .99.  My understanding is this will reset my contract for another 2 years.  Is that the case?  Hmm, I am not eligible for an upgrade, but the phone is offered to me, in addition to full retail price options, when I choose ""upgrade"" online.  Yep  I have been using an iPhone 6, but unfortunately i lost it.  So looking for cheap upgrade options.  2137162366.  Line is suspended because of the lost phone.

I completely understand. Please allow me a brief moment to get this checked out for you,  .  I see that you are on the MORE Everything Unlimited Talk and Text 3GB plan.  You have used 2.7 GB of it.  I do see that the account uses a lot of data on apps and web?  Do you close out fully on your apps. If the apps are not properly closed out they stay running even when not in use and this uses data.  Wifi does not affect the usage it actually saves the usage. If you are around wifi you can connect to it and turn the data off and it will save your data for you.  If you roam and your data is on then yes that will use the data as well,.  Do you do a lot of web exploring?  If you are around wifi you have to manually turn your data off so that the wifi and the data will not be running.  When you click settings on the iphone you will see something that says Cellular click that and then you will see where it says cellular data and you slide the button. Also yes please click out the not in use apps.  Also Lori I can apply 500MB to your account for free for a full year. Would you like that. This will not affect your contract or calling plan at all.   Ok no problem, Please allow me a brief moment to get this done for you.  That is correct.  I have successfully added the 500MB of free data for a full year at no charge to your account Lori. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  Ok and yes ma'am?  That is how much it uses and then when you click into the app it uses more as well.  That is correct. Crazy right?  You're very welcome:) Thank you for chatting with me today and being a valued Verizon customer.   You can also find us on Twitter at @VZWSupport.  Please click on the  End Chat  button to end this chat.||@Hi Maya.  This is LORI  I have seemed to have hit close to my max data usage.  I don't understand because I got an alert and ALREADY upgraded to another KB  I am not doing anything different.  I don't watch videos on my phone and I don't play games..  Yes, and if you look at my data usage, historically, it's been really  consistent  All of a sudden I got an alert...Then I added a KB...  And NOW I got another alert to go to 4!  A friend told me that if I have my Wi-Fi off, that affects usage ...  What does that mean? Because all of a sudden, I noticed my wi-fi is OFF a lot!  I double click and close the apps when I am done.  I DO use Waze (GPS)..but I was using the same apps before.  So roaming does not have anything to do with usage?  Do I have to ""turn the data off"" or if it locks into a wifi location, I'm okay?  Not a lot of web exploring..  How do I turn the data OFF?  I've never done that  Should I close down some apps I don't use anymore?  Also, what does ""Background App Refresh"" mean?  Yes, thank you  But I need to understand what I should do to prevent what has happened with extreme data usage.  So when I am at home, for instance, my phone uses my wifi from the house.  So at that point I should slide the button to turn ""Cellular Data"" OFF? I've never done that.  And then when I leave the house and I need to use the data on my phone, I will have to remember to slide the button back again?  No. But I am going to remove apps that I don't use.  I have one more question..  In the Cellular setting, each app is listed.  The buttons are in the ON position.  And each app shows a MB.  Is that how much it uses when the button is in the ON position, or only when I actually OPEN the particular app?  Like AirBnB shows 964KB..  So it uses that much just being on my phone as an app?!  Oh man... OK.. I know what I have to do now... HaHa!  Thank you.  I appreciate the free 500MB.  Thanks Maya!  Have a nice evening.||@

Thanks so much for chatting in with us today! I see here that you have been a long time customer with us since 2014. We appreciate your loyalty and want you to know that you are a valued member of the Verizon family! No you do not have to switch. You can keep your old plan.  I hate to hear that about his phone and understand how frustrating this can be but yes he can still upgrade when he comes home Kylee.  Which line is your husband's line?  One moment please.  While you are waiting, May I ask how have your service been with Verizon thus far?  I definitely understand where you are coming from. I have great news! I see that his line is eligible for the device payment program and can get a phone once he comes back.  No problem! Again, my name is Emily,  It has been our absolute pleasure assisting you and making sure you get the optimal value out of your Verizon services. Before we end, were we able to exceed your expectations and address all your needs?||@Since the new plans start tomorrow do we have to switch our plans?  Okay, and then another questions they told me today my husband can upgrade to the edge plan but he doesn't come home until Friday as he travels for work, when he comes home will he still be able to upgrade? When we did a phone claim awhile ago he ended up with a really bad phone and they asked us if we could wait until August so then he can just do the edge plan and get a new phone.  Okay, because when I went into the store today they said he can upgrade today but they can't guarantee he will be able to on Friday. I just want to make sure as he needs a good phone for his job.  507-380-1457  Okay.  It's been okay, we've had some rough patches like I said with getting sent bad phones and then this confusion with everyone upgrading.  Thank you so much! I really appreciate it! He will be very happy!  Yes. Thank you.||@

It is different than your online password, this password is used for verification of your account for security purposes and will be 3 to 5 characters long. This is the same password you use when you call in to pay a bill or go into a store.

I know the reason it is showing up like that is that the feature was added to his line, so the system recognizes him as the parent.   Yeah I can check the plan history to see what the old plan was.  Do you see the Activity, Controls, and Profiles at the top, or under Familybase any way.  Are you on a computer?   Yeah it is if you go to the My Plan and services, then click on ""Manage Familybase"" for me we will be on the same page  The line 1697 has used 17.75gb this month.   You must have had familybase set up before then because the previous plan was the same as this one but a lower amount. You started on the 6gb and slowly have worked your way up to the 15gb.  Yeah there are only 2 numbers on the familybase page  Unless you set it up to stop it always has the ability to go over. There are alerts that go out to let you know where the usage is and always able to monitor it online as well but without the familybase feature it is just understood that you would have to pay for what you use.   What happened was at some point the feature was removed from the account. I see on 07/20 actually you spoke with someone that put it back on effective 07/15 but it hasn't been set back up in order to control the data usage correctly.   we need to fix the issue with it being applied to his line instead of yours which I will do that it will take you and I a little while actually but we can fix it and get it in place. Then what I will do is because of the issues the overage will charge but you will just chat in and we will do a manual adjustment in order to resolve it this time for where the usage is at.   Yeah I am getting that now.  I have to remove it then put it back on correctly on your line.   ok it won't let me do it from here because you must have something set up already. You probably done it prior to realizing it.   I am going to show you how to remove the settings.  In order to fix it the feature needs to come off then go back on being billed to your line not his. It won't let me remove it from my side.   ARe you on the familybase page still?  Do you see the Familybase in black then there are 3 tabs below that they say ""Activity"""" Controls"" then ""Profiles""?  Will you click on the ""Controls"" for me?  We need to select the Blue writing that says ""Manage trusted contacts"" and delete those 3 contacts   Once the current settings have been removed I can put the feature on your line which will then have you the label ""parent""  You will have to set it up again though in order to do that.||@Hello, Darlene, I have two phones on my account, mine and my grandsons, They are currently incorrectly assigned. My number 918-504-7890 is shown as the child. I need this corrected so I can monitor his account.  Also, my account was hacked last month and someone walked into a store, disabled my numbers and put 7 phones and a total of $7000 of stuff on my account. The fraud department took care of taking the charges off However I am get emails to the guy who hacked me about his phones, even though they are not on my account. Also, my data plan is going over. The plan I had was with a cap - no overage. ??????  I'm going to get charged for going over, which I shouldn't be.  I'm Teri  Thank you  405-465-1697  Thank you, it's been challenging.  Yes, it is. Verizon moved very quickly, which I really appreciate.  Yes, I am.  Can you tell which plan I was on previous to the criminal activity?  I that in My Verizon?  Is that in My Verizon?  Yes  I'm looking at my My Verizon page.  I'm not sure why I'm suddenly going over?  Okay I'm there. I don't know these numbers.  My previous plan just stopped at the amount I had each month. I didn't want to be allowed to go over.  There are 3 phone numbers I do not know and aren't mine. ???  I only have the two numbers.  1697 was formerly capped at 10GB  Yes and I put 10 on 1697 and 5 on mine.  Okay, I see. these are numbers he's called or texted.  I did not approve the ability to go over the data plan and be charged.  I had it set up to stop at the 15GB. This is the first month it has gone over. Before it just stopped, which is what I wanted.  This is a change I didn't approve.  Can you correct it?  That was during the hacking episode.  ok  Can you then make my number the parent number?  ok  ok  Won't let you do what?  yes  Yes, I can take it from here.||@

I can surely check on your employee discount and the plan you are currently on. Give me a few moments please.   Okay, I see you are on the single line plan with  unlimited talk, text, and 2gb for $75.00. If you go into www.verizonwireless.com/discounts, there is a question involving the discount to be applied to what plans qualify for the employee discount. It states"" Most voice and data plans with a monthly access fee of $34.99 or higher qualify for a discount. The Monthly Account Access Fees, the portion of the fee that applies to all lines, on MORE Everything plans are also discountable if it?s $34.99 or higher. Monthly Line Access Fees, the portion of the fees that are assigned to each individual line, or no line access charge for single line plans are not eligible for discounts.""  Your current plan does not qualify for the employee discount. You would need to move to a More Everything plan with 2gb for $40.00, line access charge $40.00, and then the discount will apply to the data allowance charge.   If you were to switch to the eligible plan, total charges will be $40.00 for the 2gb, $40.00 for line access charge, employee discount will be 15% off the data allowance. Total charges to be $74.00 before taxes. With the More Everything plan you will have unlimited talk, text, and shareable data. Free international texting, free hotspot capability, and more!   With the More Everything plan you will have unlimited talk, text, and shareable data. Free international texting, free hotspot capability, and more eligible discounts. You are on a single line plan were you do not get free 25gb cloud, no free international texting, and have to pay separate for the hotspot. Once you are out of contract on 12/4/15, we can save you another $15.00 on the line access charge!   Correct! Once you are out of contract, you will save another $15.00 on the bill whereas on the single line plan you are not offered this discount. Also if you were to add new lines to the account, the More Everything plan is the familyshare plan and discount will already be applied!  If you choose to switch to the More Everything plan, your plan change would be effective as of 9/3/15! I would rather do the plan change for next bill cycle to avoid prorations and extra charges!    No, we are not able to factor in taxes and fees. It should be around the same amount you pay monthly Tracey. Taxes are based on where you live.  No, we are not able to factor in taxes and fees. It should be around the same amount you pay monthly. Taxes are based on where you live. You can view the taxes and surcharges on the bill!  No, they will not be the exact same. Taxes and surcharges vary month to month. They are not a set taxes and surcharges. The plan change will still incur taxes.   You are welcomed to think it over today if you would like! I would hate for you to feel rushed!  Great! Not a problem. I will remark the account that you chatted in today and may do a plan change to a eligible plan for your employee discount to be applied! Is there anything else I can assist you with?  It will not effect your current plan at this time. You will not be effected unless you are wanting to do a plan change in the future. We will not be doing automatic plan changes!   No you will not lose your upgrade date nor contract date change. It will only be effected once you are wanting to do a plan change in the future!   You sure? I am still here if you are needing more assistance! :)   Is there anything else I can assist you with?    Hope we work together again! It was great working with you  . I am glad I was able to resolve all your issues tonight.  We appreciate your time and business here at Verizon! Thank you again for coming into chat tonight. Have a great rest of your night! :)  Would you like me to close this chat session for you? I can surely do it for you!||@Yeah, I looked at my bill, I am supposed to get a discount on my plan through work.  I wen through the whole process of sending you guys an email from my work email.  I'm not seeing the discount on my bill.  Ok, when I was in the store they told me it was eligible and all I had to do was submit the email.  It would have been nice to know that before hand.  How much would my price change if I switch to the eligible plan?  So can you explain the difference between my plan and the eligible plan, cause they sound the same.  I currently get 2GB of data and do have unlimited talk and text.  So I currently pay 75 a month, not including the hidden charges and taxes.  So your telling me if I switch to the discount eligible plan I will get more features and pay a dollar less a month?  So if I did decide to switch to the more everything plan, when would that take effect?  So can I get a quote on what that bill would be like including tax and any other charges you would add on so I would know the exact monthly amount it would be.  So the surcharges and taxes on my current bill will be the exact same on my the 9/3 bill, if I do decide to go on the new plan?  Ok I will do that.  So I hear you guys are switching to a month to month plan or something.  How will that effect me in the future.  So I just want to confirm that I will not lose my upgrade that I currently have because of this.  Ok cool.  Just wanted to make sure.  Ill leave you alone now.  not off the top of my head.  I will certainly reach back out if any other questions come to mind.||@

I can definitely change your plan for you! Just a moment please while I get your account to be able to make that plan change for you.   While I wait for the account to load, may I ask which plan you were wanting to change to?   No problem! I'll run an analysis on the account to get your average data usage and see what data allowance would be best for you.   Thank you for your patience. I do see that you used about 3GBs of data each month. Therefore, I would recommend getting a plan that has 4GBs of data, right now that is $60.00. However, we have a new plan that will be coming out on the 13th. I would recommend moving to that plan and getting the a 6GB plan for $60.00 instead of the 4 GB plan   Yup :)   I would recommend the 6Gbs for $60.00 and chat back in on the 13th to have that added for you and backdated. :) I can note your account with all of this plan information for you, if you'd like, to make it easier for you when you chat back in to get that change made.   Will do! Just a moment while I get that noted.   Perfect! I have that noted for you. All you have to do is chat in on the 13th. Was there anything else I could assist you with?  Sure! Just a moment while I load that information.  Awesome! I do see that this discount is still there on the account. It will be active on the new plan that you are going to have added on the 13th.||@HI Kim I have to change my plan  to include more data but I can't seem to do it through my account online  I need to increase my data allowance  thanks  also, it looks like I no longer have an account discount through Suffolk University. in My Account is says it's 0%, can you confirm that  that includes unlimited voice and text?  that would be fantastic  that would be great, thank you!  cool. thanks  can you check to see if I still have an affiliate discount on my account?  for Suffolk University  cool. thank you for your help!  have a good day!||@

Glad to have you on chat. How may I help you?  I am so sad to hear that you are thinking of getting this line removed from your account.   Before we disconnect this line, I want to make sure that you are aware of all your options. Let us go over your account so together we can find the best solution for you.   I am now pulling up your account.   May I know reason why do you want to cancel this line?   Oh, I see. Thank you for letting me know, Judy.   Just to inform you, you may suspend the line without billing for 90 days so you would not have to worry about paying an activation fee of $30.00 if you will be needing a new line in the next three months. Do you have a friend or family member who might want to take over the line?  No worries. I do understand the situation so let me go ahead and take care of it for you.   While working on it, Judy, I see that you have been a loyal customer since 2008. I would just like to take this opportunity to say thank you for being such a loyal customer and we really do appreciate your business with us.  I just want to check how was your overall experience been with Verizon?  Thank you for the feedback. It is highly appreciated. We promise to continue striving hard to provide find ways to better service valued customers like you. As your representative today, I want to know how you better serve.   Almost done here.   Before finalizing this request, I am prompted to ask you when would you like the disconnect effective.   I do value your preference.    Oh, Sure thing.   Your device will stop working today. You will receive a refund for access charges that were paid in advance for the rest of the current billing cycle. Your final bill may include delayed roaming, feature or airtime charges plus taxes. Once the line is disconnected, voicemails cannot be retrieved.   If you decide to reactivate your service, you will be charged a $25 reactivaton fee. You can only reactivate an E911-compliant device and there is no guarantee of getting the same number back.     The process has been successfully completed.   I give you my warmest welcome.  Having you as a customer is important for me and helping you is my pleasure.

Thank you for chatting! May I have your name please?  Hi! How are you today  Great! I am wonderful, thank you! I would be more than happy to look into the account to see about the discount! I am just accessing the account now.  You are welcome!  Thank you so much for hanging on with me! I am showing that the discount is on the account, but employee discounts can only be apply toward a plan cost at $34.99 or higher. The current plan cost is $15.00.  I definitely apologize for the confusion! The plan cost of $15.00 includes the unlimited talk, text, and 250MB of data. There is line access fees on the smart phone lines they are $40.00 per line.   Right, increasing the plan would give you more data at a higher cost. The plan would have to be at 2GB ($40.00) or higher. I would be more than happy to compare the cost of what you currently paying to what you would pay if the plan was increased if you would like.   I can get that estimate for you now :) The discount would only come off of the plan cost, not the line charges.   I am showing with your current plan you are paying $95.00 before taxes. With the 2GB plan, you would be paying $111.20 before taxes.   The current plan is $15.00+$80.00.  The 2GB is $40.00-$8.80(discount)+$80.00.||@Laurie Johnson  I'm fine Kelsie, and you?  I have been trying for some time to get a discount available through my work applied to my account.  I thought that I had succeeded, but am wondering why it does not reflect on my bill.  OK, thanks!  I'm confused how my plan cost is only $15.00 when my monthly bill is $107.  Can you clarify what the ""plan cost"" is?  What change in my plan would make it $34.99 per month?  Would that be an increae in data?  I would appreciate that.  I guess my question is about whether the 22% discount that I understand I have through my employer applies only to the plan cost or does it apply to the smart phone line charges as well?||@

I understand the situation, I will be more than happy to provide you with the information that you're looking for regarding this matter and point you to the right direction.  Let me take a look at that account. May you please provide me with the phone number and the 4 digit security code of that account?  Thank you, may you please provide me with a different 4 digit code? that one didn't work.  If you don't remember the code don't worry, we have other methods to verify the account.  The security code is the one used in your Verizon account. The account needs to be verified first in order to open the account, if you don't remember the code do not worry, we will try the other methods.  Do you remember the security question? it says: ""What is the first name of your best friend?""  Thank you very much, it worked, I have the account open now. I can see that the security code was actually the last 4 digit of your phone number, it is: ""4388""  I can confirm that this account is associated with the ""Samsung Galaxy Note 3"", this is a 4G device. I should remind you that Visual Voicemail is not available on Prepaid for these type of phones yet. On those phones they are available in Postpaid instead.  On prepaid the only phones that have Visual Voicemail is the iPhones at this moment, don't worry, the system is being updated and hopefully Visual Voicemail will be available for your phone in the near future, you have nothing to worry about.  We appreciate your patience and understanding.  I see, don't worry, these feature will be available on that phone in the near future. You have nothing to worry about, the wait will be worth it, I guarantee it.||@I just activated my phone yesterday, and I can not get the visual voice mail to work.  ok  7659774388  1503  I don't know about any code. that is my voicemail pin  I didn't verify any code. My phone came and when I turned it on it automatically activated. Security question is Jay  ok  Ok, well I didn't know that because on my screen it says we need to update your visual voice mail service when we finish the update basic visual voice mail will be provided free of charge.  Ok thanks||@

That's not good!  I'm going to pull up your account right now so that we can see what's happening!  You're very welcome! And also, welcome to the Verizon family!  May I ask what you did in trying to pay your bill?  Alright  Okay. So, it looks like something went wrong during the payment process and triggered something with our systems.  What you'll need to do is actually call 1-866-266-1445 to get in contact with out department that is specialized in handling accounts with this issue.  Because I have limited access to what I can do, I'm not able to make any changes concerning payments.  No, not at all!  Oh my...  I would stongly suggest getting in contact with them as soon as possible or even go into the store to make the payment.  I completely understand, Devon. I know how it feels to be in this situation.  If you received the email today, I'm honestly not sure.  No, not at all.  This is the first time I've ever seen this happen.  Well, from what I can see, it was a payment reversal.  Which leads me to believe that there was an isue in communication between your bank and us.  That's good.  Just make sure to call as soon as you can.  I'll make some notes in your account  That's the best I can do for you right now||@I recently joined Verizon and I just paid my firt bill.  I got an email today saying their was a problem with my payment.  that's what I thought  it was my first time paying my bill  thank you!  On my due date I entered my information as it said and sent the payment in  e  this was done online  that's odd  when I try to re-input the payment it says I can't  I won't be able to call today due to my schedule, will that be an ssue if  I do it tomorrow  okay it said in the email my service would be interrupted and I am not even sure what went wrong  I checked the information I entered thouroughly  with being new this is very disheartening and I am a little unsettled  would it be interrupted before tomorrow?  so is this a normal thing I should expect?  It just concerns me cause I honestly cannot call until tomorrow and I feel this is not something on my end to cause this to happen  that's odd, the money is available  okay  okay||@

Hello Kip, I can definitely look into that for you. Please allow me a moment to access your account ok?  Thanks  I see you have been with us for 15 years. Thank you for your business.  Wow! That goes way back.  But young at heart.  Kip, I am seeing that for line 208-661-0945 there is an Early Termination Fee of $260.00 with a contract end date of 11/2/2016.  Kip, let me look into that for you. One moment please.  Kip, the early termination fee for that line cannot be transferred to another line. I am sorry. You could re-purpose that line for a tablet which would reduce the access charge to $10.00?  Or could someone else in your family use that line?  Sure. This line's number can be changed on the Verizon Website if needed.  Just to clarify, you want to change that line's number to a new number?  You can change that line's number to a ""new"" number, such as someone wants to change the number because of harassing calls, but not replace it with another working number.  My apologies but this line cannot be replaced with another working number on your account.  Or could someone else in your family use that line?  I regret to inform you but that is correct.  the closer you get to the contract end date the less it will cost you to cancel.  Is there anything else I can assist you with today?  I was so happy to help you out with this today! Whenever you're ready to say good-bye to me, please press ""END CHAT,"" at the upper right hand side of this chat window!

Can that obligation be transferred to another of my lines?  ok  Can that line be changed to another number?  ok - It seems like I could change that line to 2086616900 then and discountinue the line that is currently 2086616900 without penalty. right?  that won't help me - I don't want a new number  So to cancel the service on 208-661-0945 it will cost $260?  ok.

How can I help you today?  Hello Lee, I know how important the unlimited data feature is for customers that still have it as part of their plan, so don't worry, let me help you with the changes so we can get the phone activated without any issues.   Can I bother you first of all with the phone number that you want to do the change on please?  Thank you Lee, so I see you currently have an iPhone 5 on this line.   So I am just going to ask you a couple of question to make sure we start on the same page, is that ok?  Thank you Lee, so first of all, how did you purchase the new device?   Thank you Lee, and under what phone number did you purchase it on?  Oh, ok. And it is for an iPhone 6, correct?  You are very kind for all the information. Give me just one moment, since I want to see the information for the equipment.   Ok, Lee. So first of all we need to activate the equipment on the line that it was purchased under (803-361-8827) to accept the upgrade on that line, and then we can attempt to make the changes.   It is recommended Lee, just because we are doing a change. It really is a very quick change, since we are only activating it momentarily, however their service can get interrupted if they are currently using the equipment.    You tell me how you would prefer to proceed.   Oh ok, perfect. Then give me a moment to make the necessary changes.   Ok, and just to double check the details Lee, on the line 803-361-8827, you purchased the iPhone 6 of 64GB in Space Gray, correct?   Ok, thank you.   No, don't worry, that is perfectly ok. It is always better to double check all the information. That is why I was asking you.   I am almost done with the changes Lee, thanks for all your time while I am working on your account.   Thank you! I appreciate it.   So let me see, I want to start working toward the activation of your equipment. So let me ask you Lee, to make sure we are ready, do you have access to a Wi-Fi connection at this moment?   Ok, perfect. And how far did you get on the equipment Lee?   Were you at the setup wizard? Or at the main screen already?  Oh don't even worry, on the contrary. It is so much better to have it off.   I was just asking to see where you were.   Ok, Great. Lets turn it on please, Lee  Ok, great Lee, so we are going to start going through the wizard  Yes please, Lee  Ok, looks good over here as well, as far as the activation.   Go ahead and do a test call for me Lee, please. To #832  Ok, do me a favor just to make sure we push the activation. Go to Settings &#62; General &#62; Reset &#62; Reset Network Settings.  Ok, lets wait for it to turn back on.   Do you have dots of signal, Lee? And does it say Verizon on the top?  Ok, perfect. So try to place a call again, please.   Awesome! Ok, can you also test your data for me Lee. Disconnect your Wi-Fi first and make sure you can access the Internet.   Ok, double perfect!  So your phone is activate now on your number, without any changes to your unlimited data plan  Everything stayed the same.   Yes, Joseph. Don't get too worried about the plans. You don't have to change unless you want to.   Your plan is still grandfathered, we won't move you unless you initiate a change.   I know a lot of people got worried, but you will be ok.   I appreciate it, I am doing all that is possible for you since I know how important the unlimited feature can be. However on chat it is not possible to program callback otherwise believe me I would contact you immediately.   That is why I am here for Lee. And I did want to ask you another question about your line. Were you going to add any insurance to your phone?   Yes, you actually have 30 days from the date of purchase so you can decide.   Ok Lee, so last thing, since we did change the information on your other line, if they do have any kind of issues with their phone, please ask them to do the same reset network settings that we did on your phone.   If really would be your preference Lee, we can help you through Chat or call, whichever you feel more comfortable with.   Ok then Lee, so in that case did you have any other questions or concerns I can help you with?   I appreciate all the patience you had with me today Lee!   Again my name is Pam, and it has been a pleasure chatting with you. You can click on the X in the upper right of the window whenever you are ready! Enjoy the rest of your day!||@hello  I was looking to activate a new phone that i bought from verizon, however i wanted to activate it on my unlimited line account and keep my unlimited data.

I do not have this phone at the moment. This is a line of one my family members and they are currently not here.  i just called them and they would be ok if they did not have access to the phone for a while. If they did not use it for that short time would it be ok  that is correct  i transfered the upgrade from 803-530-2144 to 803-361-8827  sorry i just wanted to make sure I was being clear with everything  perfect  no thank you for your help.

I am excited that you are curious on this new VERIZON plan. Let me have a quick check on my resources here as I was just certified yesterday on this new plan. I just want you to give you accurate information.  What specifically would you like to know?  Great question! Let me check on the pricing as of today, as there might still be changes when we release it tomorrow.  I see here that you have been with us for very long time since 2005, I would like to thank you for being such a loyal customer and we really appreciate your  business with us.  I just want to check, how was your overall experience with us here at Verizon?  Everything okay, Cheryl?  Its all right, I was just checking on you.   I am now checking on your smartphones so I can give the right price for its line access fees for the new plan.  Thank you for that honesty, Cheryl. I appreciate it. I can look for better pricing options on your current more everything plan that won't compromise the services you are enjoying with us.  On the NEW VERIZON PLAN, it has 4 sizes available, smal, medium, large and x-large. That is 1gb, 3gb, 6gb and 12gb respectively.  We can avail the 12GB xlarge plan at $80.00 monthly account access fee.  As for the line access fees, your smartphones that is under edge and the basic phone will be charged $20.00 and the line that is under a contract will be charged $40.00.  That is going to be $180.00 before taxes.  That is for the current line access fee for MORE EVERYTHING.  Let me check on how much it will costs us for a 10GB more everything plan.  That is right.  For a 10gb more everything plan, it will also be $80 on the monthly account  fee, and your edge smartphones are $15 each, your contract smartphone is $40 and the basic phone is $30. They have the same $180.00, but I am seeing here that we can get additional discount of $10 on the basic phone line access fee. making the more everything10gb cheaper by $10.00. However, for this $10 difference, you get to enjoy 2GB more on the VERIZON PLAN X-LARGE plan.  Yes there will be no more 2 year contracts on the new plan. . For new customers purchasing smartphones, long term service contracts and all of their restrictions will be ending. Other devices, like tablets, are still available on 2-year contracts, and existing customers who remain on a MORE Everything plan may still purchase devices with a 2-year agreement.  Since we are existing customers who have 2 year contracts, we will be charged for the $40.00 line access fee.  Until we fulfill the contract then we will be charged for the regular 20.00 smartphone line fees.  I understand where you are coming from, Cheryl. This might be unfair to your eyes, as we are looking for the $20 line access fee that is being advertised on our ads. We could still avail it once we have fulfilled and I am seeing here that we can upgrade your current contract phone under our edge program.   The basic phone that you have on line 3096 is under an edge agreement for an s5. If we remove that line, we will be charged for the rpice of the s5.  That is correct, the line 3096 has the edge agreement for the s5 phone that is being used by line 3295.  The agreement is associated on the line 3096. what we can do is you have any spare tablet that we can activate on this line, so you can still use it for internet, and this will only costs you $10 for the line access fee, instead of $30 for the basic phone fee.  Its contract will be fulfilled on 12.02.15  That is perfect! We can activate that , we just need a new active sim for that.  Cheryl, I am now checking on the pricing if we go for the VERIZON PLAN  LARGE 6GB.  May I have the IMEI and check if we can activate it now?  I have checked on the price for a VERIZON PLAN large 6gb plan, and with your current lines, we also get it for the same price of your current more everything plan 6gb for $160.00. However, if we keep the basic phone, we can put a $10 disocunt on its line access fee, making the more everything plan6gb cheaper.  For the tablet, there will be no contract required, as what we are going to do is only activate it on the line 3096  For the tablet it will be $10  line access fee only. You can dial *#06# on that dell tablet to show the IMEI.  Could you please go to its phone settings, and there is an MEID or IMEI number there.  We can have this checked with our store represantive so we can check it for you and activate it on this line 3096. What I can do today is to lower the line access ee for the basic phone by $10.00.  I apologize for the confusion on the new plan. Was I able to answer all your inquiries about this new coming plan?  Cheryl, I would like to know on what site you are checking our new plan, we don't want valued customers like you who gets misleading information?  It is great that you have chatted with me today to make it clearer for you. Personally, I would recommend that you keep your current more everything plan, as this new plan will still go for price or feature enhancement. But if we will have a lower monthly bill with the new plan, we can definitely take advantage of it.  You are welcome! Again I thank you for your patience and your honesty with me Cheryl.

Thanks, so let me check on this end and make sure we have the correct information for you phone. If you head into your settings and tap on about phone and then status. What is the ICCID number  Thanks! I see the problem! We have the wrong sim card on the line. SO your phone does not have service to it. Lets get this fixed. Go ahead and turn your phone off while I make the switch  All switched! Go ahead and power the phone on. It should take just a few moments to get service  I am not sure, it looks like it was automated. Probably the sim card that was suppose to come with the phone possibly.   I am certainly sorry to hear that! I am glad we got you working again. Was there anything else I can help you out with?  You should have any roaming charges, unless you left the country. That is the only way to get them  Yeah, sometimes if it can not pick up service that message will pop up. It comes from way back when you could roam within the US but you are fine. No charges  Thank you for chatting with me today and being a valued Verizon customer.   You can also find us on Twitter at @VZWSupport.

It also says I am roaming, which I am NOT, I'm within a 15 mile radius of my home. My roaming feature is actually set to deny roaming...so I am very frustrated that my new phone quit working, just days after I switched phones.  360-441-9163  89148000001929487790  ok  ok  How did it get switched? I worked for a couple days just fine.  Ok, hopefully that won't happen again...of course I had 2 calls yesterday that were very important!  Thanks for your help. :)  Can you make sure I didn't have any roaming charges?  ok, it just told me in the message that I was roaming! So that was weird, I did not leave the country...lol  Ok...have a good evening, Thanks again!||@

I'm doing fantastic! How about yourself?  Oh dear! Don't those silly iPhones know they can't swim! I can definitely check in here and find out if you can upgrade and get a less aquatically challenged phone!   To start, can I get the billing password on the account?  Thank you for providing that number for me, Jim! If you'd like, I can continue to refer to you as Jim instead of James.  Also, do you have a way to contact the Account Owner? I'm not able to give any information regarding the account without proper verification, as we value the security of the account just as much as I know you do!  That is correct! I will stand by while you give him a call, that way we can pick right up where we left off.  That is correct, Jim!  No worries, I don't know how many times I get locked out of an account from forgetting passwords! The password reset button on a lot of sites are my best friend.  Oh no! Well, at least we got it right here!  So, I did see an offer here where you would be able to do an Early Upgrade to our Device Payment Agreement with a trade in. However, since your phone has water damage, and isn't quite functioning the way it should, it wouldn't be eligible for trade in. I'm looking at a few other options here that may be of more assistance.  Oh! Thank you for clarifying that for me!   Alright, Jim, thank you for your patience. From what I see here is that the only other option we have available would be to get you an early upgrade with $200.00 off of the full retail price of a device. This would work like a normal two year service agreement and extend your contract for another 24 months.   As long as the device you have right now still works, I would recommend doing the trade in to the Device Payment Agreement. It's a more solid option as it gives you a discount on your line, has a small upfront cost, usually just the taxes on the device, and you don't have to pay an upgrade fee. Not bad!  Awesome, Jim! Was there anything else I could do for you today before you go?||@Hey Kaci! How are you today?  I am doing great! I just have a question about upgrading my phone. I am currently using a really old Iphone 4 because my other phone fell into the lake. The IPhone 4 is really starting to slow down and not work correctly. Is there any way to get an early upgrade?  If not that is okay. My contract ends september 22. I was just giving it a shot  I actually don't know the billing password. My dad owns the account and gave me the admin power. Sorry  this is James by the way. The 9898600374 number  Okay that is perfect!  Yeah. I can call my dad really quick. You need to know the billing password?  My father stated that he thinks the password is 1346?  Okay perfect. He sometimes struggles with internet passwords haah  Same here. But then I can't remember the email password so it ends up being a whole process.  So actually. The phone I currently have did not actually fall in the water. I previously had an iPhone 5 that fell in the water. This iPhone 4 was a friends phone that he let me use because I didn't have another backup.  okay. So if I got to turn in the phone I would get the discount of the contract upgrade? My friend does not care if I turn in the phone.  Okay, I think I will do that. Thank you so much for the help. Really excited to get a new phone!||@

I was wondering what the fee to close my account would be?  Well AT&T has a GoPhone plan that I can take my current phone to and have unlimited data.  This would be $45 a month per phone which is much cheaper than what I am paying now. I am frustrated because I used to have unlimited data with you all, but they told me in the store that I HAD to switch to a certain data plan to be able to upgrade.  Apparently that wasn't true and that upsets me.  I read that I wouldn't be able to switch until my 2 year agreement was up.   Is that true?  Doesn't seem fair for us long term faithful customers  That is wonderful news!  So I could get 12 GB for both phones to share for $100?  How do I go about doing that?  Thank you!  Is it possible to do this online as well?  Don't always have time to call.  Do people use the wifi hotspot for home internet?  What would be the cost of that?  I have dont that before, but don't have enough data.  What bout the jetpack?  Okay!  I'll think about that!  Thank you for your help today!||@

I will be more than happy to assist you with upgrade eligibility.   May I call you by your first name?  Thank you, Jazz. I hope you are having a great day!   It will be just a few moments and I will have that information for you.   Thank you for your patience, it does appear you are eligible for an upgrade on December 3, 2016.  One moment please and I will check to see if I can find that date for you for the payment arrangement.   I am unable to see the data of the arrangement, I can provide you the phone number to Financial Services and they can provide you with the date.   In order to upgrade earlier than the upgrade date, the balance of the Device Payment Plan (formerly Edge) would have to be paid in full.   As of today, the balance is $474.81.   The Device Payment Plan does have to be paid in full in order to receive a new device.   If you look under the chat box there should be another box where you can change your name. I will be more than happy to explain our new plans to you. Allow me just a moment to get all the details together.   We are launching a new data plan that allows new pricing and sizes. It will not be required for any of our existing customers to change. We are offering data in four basic sizes: Small, Medium, Large, and XLarge. The Small will be 1GB for $30.00, the Medium will be 3GB for $45.00, the Large will be 6GB for $60.00, and the XLarge will be 12GB for $80.00.  We are working towards no longer offering two year discounted pricing and offering exclusively the Device Payment Plan. A line access fee for a customer who receive a phone at a discounted rate will pay a line access fee of $40.00 for the two year contract. A customer who is using Device Payment Plan, paid full price for their phone, or has their own device will pay a line access fee of $20.00. This line access fee will be for the Unlimited Talk and Text.  Are you still available, Jazz?  Is there anything else I can help you with today?  The device cannot be changed out until the payment plan is fulfilled.||@Hi Miranda. My  name is Jazzmika Minor. I'm calling to see if I am eligible to upgrade my LG3 to th Iphone6 Plus?  Sure I go Jazz!  OK, I also had another question. I made a promise to pay , however I forgot what date I set it for?  What's the payof amount that I would be responsible for?  Sorry! Whats the current payoff balnce?  And there is absolutley no way this will change? So its either live out the plan unitl next December or pay 474.81?  So, is it true that Verizon  has a new no plan policy that started today? Can you explain that a little more to me?  I have no idea why that question keeps posting.  Please forgive my Work Desktop  ok Thanks  Yes  Ok thats all i need for now  Oh actually there is? So even with these new products. I still have to hold on to this device until the full price is fulfilled?  OK  ! I got it. Thanks for your help||@

How can I help you?  That is a good question! Let me go ahead and pull up your account to see what is going on! Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?  Nice to meet you Amanda! For security purposes, would you please verify the last four digits of your social security number?  Great thank you so much for that Amanda! Now from what I am seeing You are on the More Everything with your unlimited minutes so you are good to keep making calls, this may just because you switched in the middle of your plan or the computer has not updated with the change so you can disregard those messages.  Also based on your usage you are on the best plan for yourself and lines. The texts are unlimited as well so you are good as well, but yes your data is nearing the limit before you get overage charges.   I can suggest some ways to help conserve data or we can move up on data so you can avoid a overage but there would be a month in advanced charge but you would get all the data with no worries of overages.   I am seeing you are on the 6GB but I am guessing the change was done on demand so you will not see the new data allotment until the beginning of the next bill cycle.   When you move up on your data allotment you should always ""back date"" the change if you can then if not then put it for the next because if you on demand it you will not get the data.  Ah yes well then that is a key reason to why you are not getting all that data.   I apologize on the behalf of Verizon that should have been disclosed to you Amanda! The charge is $15.00 a GB, so if you see it more economically better to take the charge I would advise that but I can see if we can get that fee waived because we did not on our end disclose that to you to help.  Well normally when you go up on a plan, like a plan that cost more than yours, you can back date the change to get the whole amount but in your case it was not backdate like it should have been. Alright but I can only get 1 overage fee waived, so if you continue to go over I cannot get those covered.   I can send you a link to a data calculator to see your estimates if you would like?   Ok one moment, and alright then let me get approval on that, but since this usage has not been billed yet you will need to come back to us and ask for the credit but we will have the account remarked so they know what is going on. That is normally the starting for people with hot spots but if it is in your budget then I would suggest just get how much you can pay for because overage fees can stack up.  I also see I can offer you 500MB for free for a year!    Sure no problem Amanda! Well actually I was wrong with some information about the credits I told you but it is good news, Since we are awfully embarrassed because we misinformed you for the plan change, we will actually cover up to the 4GBs of overages of the 6GB you are suppose to have. I will remark your account so that way when you get charged you will have up to $60.00 of overages covered. And the 500MB is a little promo and a little incentive for being a loyal customer with us, there is no obligation from your end what so ever.   Yes I am apologize just trying to proof read.  No problem well your account is promptly remarked and ready for you to call or chat back in to get those credits. Now about the 500MB of promo data did you wish to go ahead and take it? I cannot assure if we will still offer this another time you chat or call in?  No ma'am I would not offer you something that would tie your hands up more, it is a promo for a year so one a year is up it will go away, there is no contract extensions or anything it is a good way to give you a little extra wiggle room on data.  Ok no problem, then that is all done for you as well! I hope I did all I could for you and answered any questions you have!   Did you have any other questions or concerns you had with me today?  Ok then fantastic!   You are welcome Amanda anytime to help you! b  I'm glad I was able to take care of you today! When you are ready to say goodbye to me please hit ""END CHAT"" at the top right hand side of this window. Have an awesome rest of your day and thank you for being the best part of Verizon!  You have a good one Amanda! Stay happy.   No problem.||@i have a question about my minutes  I am getting notices that i am soon to exceed my limit  however i recently upgraded to a 6G plan  so I am confused  when does the 6G plan take effect?  Amanda Maddux  8067  the messages are about Data  I should have unlimited calls and text  so Data is my most concern  how can that be if i upgraded recently to a 6G plan?  when does my plan switch over to 6G and not 2G which was the old plan?  I have only used 2.352G which is no where near 6G  i worked with a rep and they did not mention that at the time  since i am using the hotspot now  i am sure i will go over, as we are using it to connect to the internet and surf, etc..  what will the overage charge be?  yes, when i bought the hotspot from you  the rep was supposed to update the plan  as obviously we are going to use more  they did not mention that i had to wait until the end of the cycle  Yes that would be helpful if they can waive it  I hope 6G will be enough, i will just have to test it out and see  yes that would be helpful  if they can waivve 1 fee  i might be able to make into the next cycle  Is 6G typical for someone using a hotspot device?  thanks for the credit info, i will call back in when it goes over  what is the 500MB regarding?  Are we still connected?  great thank you  so i don't need to do or buy anything to get it?  great, sounds good  yes please apply it to my account  no, that is all i had  thank you for your help  same to you, thank you!||@

Hi Colleen I can definitely go over the account information with you. What do you mean exactly when you stated you re-negotiated?  Why do you need data with your basic phone?  Right, I would suggest you get our 700 minutes plan with unlimited texting for 35.00 monthly.  I am showing you have only averaged 225 minutes within the last 3 months.  We can have you on a unlimited talk and text plan for 50.00 monthly  Did you get my suggestion with the 50.00 for unlimited talk and txt  Pay as you go would be 50.00  For unlimited talk and text  The bill that is due now is 83.53  I am showing the 1g plan which you do not need and for those months it will be 73.00 but with my plan it will be about 65.00 with taxes.||@Hi, my contract ends on 10/25/2015.

I was advised to wait until today for new plan deals  I only need a plan for 2 GB at most ever  I have been paying way too much at $85 for a basic phone  I want to buy a phone out right this time-seems better in the end  I do not need internet data at all  I never have used the internet on my phone  Not enough minutes-I am up to 911 now  My 84 mother talks forever  I appreciate you explaining that to me  I am paying double what my friends are paying for a smartphone umlimited usage  Can you see what the new revised bill is  It has not posted to my billing usage  What ABOUT A PAY AS YOU GO SINCE MY USAGE CHANGES  yes  But do you have access to my current billing  Do you have access to my account  What about for September and October  I got a new plan two nights ago  Confusing because new bill changes are not up  Thanks but I will re-check my emails-he said $20.00 off and more discounts bye for now||@

It is $99.99 for the 32GB iPhone 5s and pre owned for $49.99. The promotion may only apply to specific phones.   Sorry 16GB is $99.99, the 32GB is $149.99.   Sorry about that.

Whom do I have the pleasure of chatting with this evening?   Nice to meet you Victoria! Upgrading a phone can be super exciting and I am prepared to answer all questions and help you the best way possible.   Okay, you are correct I do see here that line is eligible for an upgrade. With the new plan that we are offering that is mainly geared towards our new customers. Would you prefer to do a 2 year upgrade?   Our device payment agreement does lower your bill for you. That agreement is when you pay full price for a device in 24 month installments. You could do that today or tomorrow. Also you would not have a $40.00 upgrade fee if you do the device payment agreement. Also if you move to our new plans then your line access fee would be lower as well. This is when the savings would come into play. With our new plans your line access fee would be $20.00 instead of the usual $40.00.   But if you choose to do the 2 year contract then you would have a $40.00 upgrade fee as well as paying for the device.   But getting the phone today you could pay the 2 year contract pricing.   Versus tomorrow you would only be able to do the device payment agreement.   When under our device payment agreement you do not have to pay outright for the device. You would be paying in the 24 month installments. You would still be paying full price just not in one lump sum. If you chose to get the device today then you would pay the price of the 2 year contract and the $40.00 upgrade fee.   Just checking in are you still with me?   If you did do a 2 year contract today then you would pay the pricing for the 2 year contract you would not have to pay full price. But if you do sign another contract you would have a $40.00 upgrade fee.   You are more than welcome. May I help you with anything else this evening?   Thank you so much for chatting with me today. You were wonderful and I am glad that I was able to help you.We deeply appreciate your services with us since 2003. I hope that you have a wonderful day!

If I bought the iPHone 6 today for $199.99 versus tomorrow, wouldn't buying it today be the better way to go based on the changes that are coming where you either buy your phone outright or finance it through Verizon monthly?  Typically when you do an upgrade you buy the phone for example $199.99 and sign another 2 year contract.  If I buy the phone today wouldn't I be paying the $199.99 versus tomorrow I would either buy the phone outright for $650 or finance for 2 years for $27.00 a month?  So buying the phone today I would get it cheaper than I would tomorrow?  but that's where it get's confusing - if I buy it today I will only pay $199.99 for just the phone - under the new plan I will pay $650 outright or that monthly fee.  So am I not really getting the phone cheaper buying it outright today for $200 so I would be saving $450 wouldn't I?  what am I missing?  ok way to confusing - basically either way no matter when I purchase a new phone I will have to pay full price?  that just doesn't seem to make any sense but I guess I will leave it at that.  Got it - thank you for your time and helping me through this. Have a good night.  No I'm good.  Thank you again.||@

And no problem!  We will no longer be offering contracts to new customers and will only offer the option of our Device payment or buying the phone out right at full retail price.   The cost of your phone is split into 24 monthly payments.  You would be able to once they are released which will be very soon.  But plan changes do not affect contracts or vice versa. And also, device payments are not a plan. But once the new plan are available,we will be able to quote them for your account for the best deal.||@Hello!

Let me take ownership of the issue. I can definitely help you in checking for the best option to upgrade your plan to.  You're welcome. Allow me to pull up the account to assist you better.  Emily, I have successfully pulled up the account!  I have a good news to share!  More Everything will be considered as grandfathered plan starting August 13. Once your contract expires, you may avail our new plan called One Plan. This will give you unlimited messaging and minutes (basically,same as the features of More Everything Plan) with lower monthly line access fee!  You can have our Medium size One Plan that includes 3GB shareable data for $45.00/month + $20.00 line access for each smart phone.  Once migrated to One Plan, there will be two options to upgrade your device. It's either paying the retail price or enrolling to Edge/Device Payment.  It's before the company discount, Emily.  Sure, I can check that for you!  Would you like to have iPhone 6 with 16GB memory?  That's perfectly fine! iPhone 6 16GB is only $27.08/month for 24 months.  yes, you can keep your current phones. The good thing about Device Payment is you can upgrade anytime as long as you've paid the price in full. No contract!  I can give you the estimate monthly costs if you will upgade btoh phones to iPhone 6 and change your plan to One Plan.  Let's say that you will move your plan to One Plan 3Gb $45.00/mo (less 19%) + $20.00 line access for each smart phone + $27.08 Edge installment foreach phone, this will total your bill to $130.61 before taxes.  Oh! That's okay, you may consider a different phone models to upgrade your device to which will even lower the monthly costs.  I understand. No worries, I will put a note on the account so we can put you in our top priority list to be informed first of the available new promotions in the area.  The available plans were divided into different sizes. We have Small 1Gb for $30.00, next is Medium 3Gb for$45.00 and Large 6GB for $60.00.  If you will keep your phones, you'll have $45.00 (less 19% discount) + $20.00 line access fee for each smart phone, will total your bill to $76.45 before taxes.  We cannot determine the exact amount for the taxes, but I can give you an estimate amount basing on your previous bills.  Emily, if we will to add the taxes and fees, total monthly bill will be $96.45.  The Surcharges and Other Charges &#38; Credits is not yet included in $76.45. I'd say that taxes and other fees is around $15-20.00/month.  That's great! The One Plan will launch in August 13 and the lines should end thir contract first for the $20.00 new line access will apply  on the account.  *to apply on the account  Just to make sure I understand correctly, will we pay our current line access fee of $40 until our contract is up in September?  Oops, not sure what happened there!  Somehow I changed my name, lol  That's okay.. That is correct, Emily. But one the contract expires, it will be changed to $20.00 line access fee (if you will move to One Plan).  Got it. That's fine  Awesome! To make sure I've got you covered, is there anything that I missed or failed to discuss on this chat?  I don't think so  Thanks! Your satisfaction is my priority. Is there anything else that I can help you with?  No, that's it. Thanks!  Sure! You're more than welcome, Emily.  If ever you need to chat with us in the future, I hope I'm lucky enough to chat with you again.. You may click the END CHAT if you're ready to say goodbye to me.  Thank you for allowing us to service you today, and thank you for being the best part of Verizon Wireless! You can also find us on Twitter at @VZWSupport.

My contract is ending next month and I wanted to see what your available plan options are to make sure I'm getting the best value. I'm looking for unlimited talk/text and at least 2 GB of data to share between two phones  Thank you!  Okay, great  What is the access fee on this plan?  on the One Plan, that is  are those fees before or after my company discount?  and what is the device payment plan for an iPhone 6?  what would the cost be after the discount and including taxes and fees?  thank you!  I'd like to check the price at least. :)  And would we have the option to keep our current phones?  Good to know  Okay. Our budget is $100/mo. after taxes and fees. We have a little one on the way and need to cut costs. :)  We're happy with our iPhone 5cs now, so I think the only way we'd upgrade is if we could get the iPhone 6s within our target price range.  Thank you. Just curious, what is the price difference between 2 and 3 GB on the One Plan?  Oh, I see. So if we keep our current phones, can you tell me the final cost of the medium plan minus my discount plus taxes and fees?  Thank you. On my current bill, there's a line item for ""Verizon Wireless' Surcharges and Other Charges & Credits."" Is that amount included in the $76.45 and if not, what would the additional amount be?  Okay, sure  Okay, we will go with that plan, then||@

How are you doing this evening?  Oh dear, I can certainly understand where your concern lies. Please allow me just a moment to pull up your account.  Oh! No problem. I am doing well. Thank you so much for asking.  May I please have your name at this time?  Hi there, Adam. It's great to meet you. May I ask how your week has been?  I can certainly understand a week like that!  As for your concern, I am looking over your bill at this time.  I should be back with some information here shortly, I appreciate your patience.  In the meantime, may I ask how you have been enjoying your Verizon service?  That is very strange, I cannot say for sure what the reasoning would be for such a thing. There is not much I can do regarding that issue. However, you may be able to take your device into the nearest store and have them trouble shoot it physically on our network to see if there is a way that they can boost the service connection for you, Adam.  Oh yes, I completely understand. I am currently looking over your charges at this time, to see where the numbers given to you had originated.   It should only be a moment longer.  I am just typing up my findings for you now, Adam. I appreciate your patience, thank you so much.  Okay, Adam! So it appears as though both of your devices have mobile insurance for $11.00. This is in addition to your $15.00 line access charges. Together, this totals $52.00 for line access and insurance. However, line 5886 also has roadside assistance for $3.00.  This totals $55.00 monthly for both lines.  In addition to your line charges, there is a $70.00 charge for your service plan. However, this has your employee discount which lowers it to $59.50. Together, this is a total of $114.50 +taxes.  To clarify, Adam, you would like the roadside assistance removed from line 5886?  To be clear, the insurance is being removed from both lines at this time?  Okay, no problem. I will get those removals started now.  However, in addition to these monthly charges, there is the charge for your new devices. This charge is $27.08 each--which totals $54.16. This amount can be added to the price of all service plan charges and line access charges.  At this time, I am removing those features and will be able to recalculate your new monthly charges. I appreciate your patience.  I am glad you are addressing this issue, Adam. Please allow me a moment to type up my response.  I will indeed be able to give you the end bill estimate once these removals process. However, I will be unable to make changes to your current bill cycle. Anything that is currently due will remain due. However, you will be receiving the credit (for the features that were removed) on your next bill  Can you please further expand on your question, Adam, so I may better answer it at this time?  I understand completely, Adam.  At this time, can you please provide me with the timeframe in which you had purchased your new devices?  Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much.  I am currently looking over the history on your account and will return with some information shortly. I appreciate your patience.  Hi there Adam. I appreciate your patience and kindness with me at this time! Can you please tell me real quick how your upgrades were processed? Was this something you had ordered in store with a representative?  Yes, the portion regarding your $200.00 credits is correct; you should see that credit present on your next bill.  I am typing up my response for you now, Adam.  In regard to your concern about the $11.00 mobile protection, I have been able to confirm that you did decline the protection on both devices at the time of purchase.  However, the $3.00 roadside assistance on line 5886 has been active since May 2, 2015, before the upgrades had taken place, and appears as though it had been added through My Verizon. For this reason, I am unable to credit back any charges regarding the $3.00. What I will be able to do is remove the feature for you today, which will give you back $2.12 from August 12 to September 3.  I am still in need of calculating that for you, Adam. At this time, I am typing up the explanation for what your next bill will look like in terms of your credits.  It appears as though that is how the feature was added in May of this year, yes.  I understand where you are coming from, Adam. You will be able to see the charges for the roadside assistance and when it was added on your June 2015 invoice.  This can be seen on My Verizon. If you go to the homepage and view your current bill, there will be a drop-down menu on the page that loads that will allow you to choose which bill cycle you are viewing.  Can you please clarify for me, with the details aside, that I am indeed, currently removing your mobile phone insurance and the roadside assistance from your account during this chat?  I understand. Please allow me just a moment to type up my response.  Wonderful, thank you. Those changes are updating now.  As for the feature on your bill: since the feature was added on May 2, 2015, it had happened after your April bill had generated (for April 4 to May 3). This means that the charge for the feature will first appear on your May 4 to June 3 billing, and will appear as a charge under line 5886. With the ""Roadside Assistance"" line, you will be able to see the dates in which the charge covers.  I completely understand where you are coming from, Adam. If I could go back in time and remove the charge for you, I would. However, there are no indications on your account that show that the feature should not have been added nor that it should have been removed at any time.  The only details that are available to me are showing that the feature had been added on May 2, 2015. I am unable to see any reasons nor the location of the changes.  There are no indications on your account that show that the feature should not have been added nor that it should have been removed at any time. For this reason, I will be unable to issue any credits for the $3.00 feature. However, I will be able to remove it on today's date to help you receive some of that charge back for this billing cycle. In addition, I will be able to credit you back the charges that have been made to your account since July 2 in regard to your mobile insurance features. I am completing those calculations now to help better set expectations for your net bill, Adam.  next bill*  At this time, I have been able to completely remove the insurance from both lines and also remove the roadside assistance from line 5886. On your next bill, you will receive a credit for both of these features from August 12 to September 3. However, there are still the credits for the insurance being added to both lines from July 2. Please allow me a moment to explain those amounts for you, Adam. I appreciate your patience.  Since your bill cycle begins on the 4th of every month, there were only two days in your June to July bill cycle where the insurance was added: July 2 and July 3. The charge for these days with the insurance on both lines is a total of $1.40. You will see a credit for that amount for those dates.  The next bill cycle, July 4 to August 3, there was a total charge of $22.00 for the insurance on both lines. You will also see a credit for that amount for those dates.  Since we have removed the insurance on today's date, this means that you would have really only had it for 8 days in this bill cycle. That is a total charge of $5.66 for both lines. Your next bill is going to look quite crazy in regard to this change on today's date; there will be a $5.66 total refund for the first 8 days and a second refund of $16.34 for the last 23 days of this billing cycle, totaling $22.00 for the insurance on both lines ($11.00 each).  The total amount of adjustments that will be made on your bill should be right at $45.40 for the insurance adjustments over the last three billing cycles.  As for the roadside assistance, you will see a refund of $2.23 from August 12 to September 3. This will total your adjustments, overall, to an estimated $47.63.  Yes, that is expected to be on the next bill, as well, for the trade-in values.  I am glad you are clarifying with me, Adam.  Sometimes, with trade-in values, the system will not recognize the promotion and may need to be manually updated. This does not happen very often, however, it is a possibility. Your trade-in credits are expected to appear on your next bill (since the current August 4 to September 3 billing cycle is the second bill cycle since your trade-in) without any issue. However, if they are not applied, this simply means that we will need to make the change happen manually. We will only know whether it needs to be done manually once your next bill has generated.  This does not happen very often, however, it is a possibility. Your trade-in credits are expected to appear on your next bill (since the current August 4 to September 3 billing cycle is the second bill cycle since your trade-in) without any issue.  Yes, of course Adam. I am typing that for you now.  I really appreciate your patience with me at this time! I have been able to look over your account do not currently see any other active features on either line. Your 6GB More Everything plan is priced at $70.00, but with your employee discount of 14%, the charge is actually $60.20. Then, there are the $40.00 line access charges for each line. However, by being on our device payment plans (previously known as the Edge), your lines qualify for $25.00 off of the $40.00 for each line. This totals $15.00 per line, which is $30.00.  $30.00 + $60.20 is a total of $90.20 plus taxes. | $27.08 for your device payment, times two for both lines; this totals $54.16 | $90.20 + $54.16 = $144.36 +taxes.  You are very welcome, Adam! There have been many charges discussed during this chat session and I am glad I was able to get your account back to the pricing it should be. Did you have anything else I could do or answer for you before you go?  I have not heard from you for a few moments, Adam; are you still there?  I understand where you coming from, completely, Adam. I do not under any circumstances believe that you have been trying to game the system; I believe in you as a customer and I appreciate your loyalty. However, there were no indications on your account that the $3.00 feature should not have been added, so I am unable to make any changes to previous bill cycles regarding the matter. I was able to mention that I would have gone back to make the changes for you if I could, because I do understand where you are coming from.  With that being said, I do realize that this chat has lasted much longer than you anticipated, though it was due to the catch of the added insurance from July. It wasn't until further conversation and research that we both confirmed that the insurance should not have been added. If the insurance topic had been addressed much sooner, we would have been able to end our chat session much sooner, and you would have been able to get back to your family.  Verizon does indeed train its representatives with compassion and empathy--which I have very much of for you. I apologize that you feel as though I was unable to portray that characteristic towards you; it was never my intention to make you feel as though I did not care about you as a customer or a person.  That's really great to hear, Adam. Thank you. I am very glad I was able to assist you to the best of my abilities this evening, and that we caught the charges that had been spiking your bill. Is there anything else I can do or answer for you before you go?  It was my pleasure! Thank you for giving me this opportunity.  I would like to take this moment to thank you for being such a terrific Verizon customer (and for being so wonderful to chat with). We are very lucky to have you. I hope you have a great evening with your family, Adam!

But good.  Thanks for asking  To be honest I have terrible coverage at work.  Seems like my coverage was better with my older phone.  Not sure why that would be  Yeah.  That's not too much of an issue for me right now.  The bill is the bigger issue  Ok.  Well we definteily did NOT agree to that.  I would like that removed please.  I want the roadside assistance removed and the mobile insurance removed.  Yes please  Can you please adjust my current bill and reissue it without all those extra charges.  But before you do that, can you please confirm what my monthly bill should be?  To be clear, you are charging me for something I did not authorize?  We did not agree to insurance and roadside, therefore I will not pay for those fees.  My current bill needs to be adjusted so that I never pay for something that I did not authorize Verizon to charge me for.  I am not 100% positive, but I believe it was July 2 or July 3.  I went into a Verizon Wireless store (not an authorized retailer).  Our plan was up and we were set for an upgrade.  We upgraded but said we didn't want our monthly bill to increase much.  The Verizon representative looked at our plan and told us he could get us the iPhone 6's and we would only be paying about $10 or so more a month (that would have put us in the $140 range.  Plus he said that we would get $200 credit for turning in our old devices but that wouldn't happen until the second billing cycle.  Ok.  What about the rest  So what does that mean?  How much should my current bill be?  And I need you to explain the My Verizon thing to me.  Your saying that I logged into My Verizon and added roadside assistance?  That definitely did not happen.  I need proof of that.  I have a brand new car that comes with roadside assistance, I would never have my cell phone company provide me with roadside assistance  I am looking at my bill that was due on June 28, 2015.  I can not find the roadside assistance.  Where will it be on the bill.  I do NOT use My Verizon for billing.  Yes, I want you to remove the insurance which I already declined and I want you to remove the roadside assistance which I never activated.  Ok.  I see the on line charge on that 7 page bill.  I still don't understand how that was added.  I did not add roadside assistance.  We have been customers with Verizon for over 7 years and have never added roadside assistance.  Why would I do that?  I'm telling you it should have never been added.  And you can't prove to me how it was added.  It;s just shows that it was added.  We are arguing over $3.  It's the principal for me.  I have given Verizon thousands of dollars over the years and have never been late on a payment and you can't credit a $3 charge that you have little to no information on.  On top of that, I have just spent an hour talking to Verizon instead of spending the time with my family.  For something that was Verizon's mistake.  Yes, you already told me that.  That still doesn't address the fact that I spent an hour typing to you for something that was Verizons mistake.  Don't credit me the $3 for the roadside assistance, instead credit me for the time I spent on my computer instead of with my wife and kids.  This is common sense.  Like I said, it's not the $3.  It's the principle.  Ok  Plus the $200 for the device turn in?  What do you mean expected?  So I will have to spend another night talking with a Verizon representative  Yes, you said that already  Can you please tell me what my bill should be going forward.  I want to make sure that I am in the $140 range as promised  Thank you!  That's what I expected and was told.  I want you to know that I am still upset about the $3.  And that I am even more upset that I have been on the computer with you for so long for something that was Verizon's mistake.  Also, I don't blame you, but it appears Verizon has you guys so concerned about being professional that you seem to lose your compassion.  Hopefully someone in the training department can review this conversation.  I would have preferred if you would have said, ""Adam, you are right, we shouldn't have charged you $3 and I am so sorry that you are on the computer instead of being with your family.  Unfortunately Verizon doesn't allow us to credit the $3""  Thanks for your help and I hope Verizon learns to treat is loyal long term, never late on a payment customers with a little more compassion.  I am not a loser trying to game the system and my account should reflect that.  Don't take it wrong, it's not you as a person, its the fact that Verizon doesn't allow you to credit $3 for someone that clearly did nothing wrong to deserve all this headache.  It's corporate non sense.  Either way, thanks for your help.  you have been great.  I still don't love Verizon as a corporation and that's not because of you.  You actually did a great job.  No thank you very much||@

How are you?  I?m sorry to hear you?re thinking of removing some of your lines. We really appreciate your business and I?m sure together we can find a solution that keeps you as a valued Verizon Wireless customer.  What's going on that leads you to want to remove this line??  Congratulations on your new iPad! Aren't you going to use that instead and activate it on this account, Misty?  Oh I see. I don't think that we need remove the old one then as it has been replaced by the new iPad already.  Ohh  So, you added a line to get the new iPad, Misty?  Got it. Thanks, got a bit confused there. Sorry about that. What we can actually do on that line is to switch it as a phone line and use it as your back phone. I can give you a promotion for $15 discount for that line and then I will increase your data to 4GB for the same price of $60. How that sound?  You're welcome. One moment, Misty.   Please give me 2-3 minutes  While working on this, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you on how is your service with Verizon so far?    That's great to hear! We always strive to provide excellent customer experience and I'll make sure that you'll get the same today.

Changing to that plan now would only affect the 0052 line but I can add that discount now   If you switch to the new plan it will automatically switch. But if you keep your current plan then we have to add it for you   But that is correct the 8303 line is under contract until 08/24   You would be saving money, but with the new plans that come out tomorrow there option goes from 12GB to 20GB there isn't anything in between that   But the 12GB plan is $20 less than what you pay now  That is correct, and you will receive a notification on the 24th about the discount for that line   That is correct, you will continue to receive that discount as long as there are no further changes. But I would recommend looking into the new plans after the other discount is added just in case you may like that better   Great! Is there anything else at all that I can assist you with?  No problem, the discount is on the account and you're all set!   That is correct, once it updates on the account you will get an email  Same to you!

I'll go over your rates and options for Canada. What dates will you be travelling?  let's take a look at how that fits into your bill cycle.   Okay, so aug 21 is actually the last day of your current bill cycle so you'd get a prorated allowance for just that one day   but the plans are as follows.   For $15 per-line that needs it we have a plan for 100MB of data and 100 Talk minutes, texting is unlimited per your domestic plan. For $25 per line those limits are raised to 500 minutes and 1GB of data. The Overage rate if you go over those allowances would be $10/100MB for data and 10?? per minute for calls for the first plan and then 5?? per minute and $20 for 1GB of data on the 2nd plan.    Sure thing, I can set that up for you now.  You'll want to contact us to cancel it once you return since I'm setting up a future dated order for the date you're leaving I can't future date a 2nd order to remove until that plan goes into effect on the 21st  sure thing. bear with me just a moment and I'll get that changed.  for some reason its not coming up for me so bear with me. Sorry it's taking so long  Okay, so it looks like the reason we can't add the $25 plan is because you have a CDMA only phone and the $25 plan is built around current global devices so we only have the $15/100 option or we can do $30 for 250 each. Sorry I've only just run into this for the first time since most people have a global capable smartphone  okay, sorry about that Dan. I guess I learn something new everyday.   lol I hear you. The 4 has held up pretty well considering it first launched in 2010 :)   plan is setup for you, do you know how to enable your roaming on that phone?  settings &#62; cellular &#62; roaming &#62; voice and data roaming ON  also you'll want to dial *228 option 2 before you leave  My pleasure! Does that resolve all of your concerns tonight?  You are most welcome :) Thanks so much for chatting with me and I?m glad I could help. You may click the End Chat button when you?re ready to close out.  Have an awesome trip and take care!||@I?m headed to Canada and wanted to know if I can use my phone there? And if I can use my internet or should I put it on airplane mode?  Aug 21-29  ok the $15 should be just fine. I only need it on the 269-908-0678 #  This will only be on for the one month correct?  or do I have to call and cancel it?  Well looking at it let just go to the $25 plan that way I know I have plenty  no problem  $15 is fine  no problem the wife keeps telling me its time to get a new phone :)  right I have no problems with mine so I don't want to give it up  no I don't  ok will do.  thanks for you help  yes that will do it. thanks||@

Sounds like someone's being a data hog. My brother uses 20GB a month so I know where you're coming from. We actually offer a premium feature called Verizon Family Base that is free for the first month and only $5 a month after that and allows you to set individual data limits for each line on your account! It has other control options as well but the data limit is it's key feature.  You can actually sign up online right here. Since the controls/monitoring of Family base is very private we do not allow ourselves any control over it to ensure customer privacy.  Not a problem!

Let me take a moment to bring your account in to view.  Gary, let me first start out by asking, have you made any major changes to your plan or service lately?  Ok, thank you.  Thank you for your patience while I'm looking this over.  Gary, as far as I can tell, the current balance looks normal, there is no past due amounts, and this current amount is not due until September 1st.  That's not what I'm showing, so that's a relief. Are you looking at a paper invoice?  That's what I'm thinking too, depending on how quickly your bank releases the funds from the account, it will pend for about a day once it's disbursed.  I did not spot any declined or NSF messages, let me check in to that a little further.  Well, so far all looks normal as can be on this side of things, nothing unusual or remarkable.  Was there anything else you would like to review with me, Gary?  Great! Once again Gary, my name is Justin and I want to thank you for being the very best part of the Verizon Wireless family, enjoy the rest of your evening!||@I am just wondering why my bill is twice the amount, when I paid my august 1 bill  ok  no  ok  but its showing over $500?  no, I am looking on the internet  I was thinking maybe it hasn't cleared from my payment from what I made a payment on Friday  but this has never happened before...It normally shows off by monday late... of my payment from you guys and then cleared from my bank by monday about  ok, thanks  ok thanks. guess i will check back tomorrow or friday and see if its cleared on my side by then  no, that's all, thanks  thanks, you too||@

(10 Extremely Helpful, 0 Not Helpful at All)*||@10||@Based on your most recent chat with Verizon Wireless, did the last representative you chatted with fully understand and take action to resolve your concern?*||@10||@||@||@starting sometime yesterday my phone refuses to pick up 4g  That's a bit weird for sure!  What's the phone number experiencing these problems?  6073827749  Thank you!  By the way, you did some awesome trouble shooting here.   The 3g network works fine.  When I go into my mobile data settings I can select LTE only, and the phone acts like there is no connection.  I go back to global settings, and 3g only will pick up.  Ive done a speed test to see if the phone is just misreporting, but I cannot get more than 1.5mbps download, where before I was in the 6-10 range.  SO strange! Are there any other Verizon customers in your area experiencing the same thing?    Nope.  My roommate has verizon and his is working fine (I am in buffalo ny).  Okay, cool, thank you  SO weird. I'm checking some network things here on my end  And as I said, this was very random.  No new software, etc.  And basically everything I can think of short of a new SIM wont work.  However, seeing as I get 3g, I cant imagine the physical SIM is the issue.  I'm going to try a network sync, bear with me  ok  Almost done  Go ahead and power your phone off for me real quick. Wait for 30 seconds, and then boot it on again  I re-synced it with the network  Once it's back on, let me know. And we'll proceed with some testing  ok rebooting now  Perfect  ok rebooted  still 3g only currently  That's so weird. I'm going to run a diagnostic on here righ tnow  ok  So I DO see something that COULD have an affect here.   I'm showing that this device is rooted.  yea.  its been rooted since about 2 hours after I had it and never had a problem.  I did relock and unroot it earlier, go back to stock 4.4.4 to no affect.  Right on. So here's the thing with a rooted device. From a troubleshooting standpoint with Verizon corporate, that's going to be something we'd have to ask you to undo, since that's a pretty big variable in device functionality. It voids the warranty, on top of that... so to REALLY begin figuring this out, I'll have to ask you to unroot it here and we'll continue.   ok.  its not currently rooted oddly enough however.  I just did an RUU and so its stock with unlocked bootloader  I just pinged the device here, and I'm showing that the device is rooted at this time. I just did a refresh, so maybe something was missed. We need the phone back to stock.  I lied, it is rooted.  unrooting now.  Okay awesome  Lemmie know when you're booted back up  try again should be good  Cool, I'll give it a sec here  COOL that's what I'm lookin' for.   Let's go to Settings &#62; Mobile Data &#62; Preferred Network &#62; LTE Mode if available  ok  As soon as I switch I just get no bars with an ""x"" above it  Weird... and it's on Global regularly correct?  yes  as I said, when on global it will connect to 3g just fine, but no 4g connection  Yeah. That's weird.   Have you tried a Factory Reset yet?  yep.  Unrooted factory reset?   not unrooted. will try now .  Yeah, let's give that a shot and see what happens here.   ok, just rebooting now .  Awesome, thank you!  going to be a bit, its going through the upgrading of apps.  30 of 279 right now  Seein any data indicators?  no i havent gotten that far into the reboot yet.  Still at the screen where it updates the apps after u clear the dalvik  Gotcha. Well let's talk options if this doesn't work while we're waiting  ok  1 of two things will obviously happen here. 4G will come back... or it won't. If it doesn't, it's obvious it's not a software issue... PROBABLY a hardware issue... I'd probably recommend visiting a Verizon store and trying another SIM card... it's POSSIBLE that's the problem. Not likely, but possible.   ok  I was thinking that there could have been a short or something, but I feel like that would destroy the entire radio, not jsut the 4g  That's possible.   I honestly have no idea. I've seen phones with software issues that block 4G data or apps that do it.   But a phone that JUST gives 3G if it's not one of those. Yeah, I've never seen that before.   Yea, Ive gotten myself in that issue with an adblocker or something, but the fact that I have gone all the way to the point of stock reflashing a downgrade makes me think its not app related.  Tough to say how's the progress?  212/279  almost there  Okay, cool. Also, the warranty is expired, and there's no extended warranty attached to the device, so a replacement of the phone won't be an option. You're always welcome to try HTC or locate another phone to use on the network in that case, too. We have some Certified Pre Owned phones available for purchase too.   what would a certified preowned cost me vs. a new m9?  Sure! lemmie check  beautiful! the factory reset without root did the trick!!  Bingo!  awesome!!!!!  thanks for the help.  I really appreciate sticking with me.  This was a weird one for sure.  My pleasure, I'm just stoked it worked!!! Any other questions for me today?  nope thanks again.  i appreciate the time and effort.  If you have a survey or anything I can fill out to commend you I would be glad to do so.  Thanks!  You rock! You may get one of those when you hit the End Chat button! They pop up sometimes :P Thanks, much appreciated!!! Have an awesome rest of your day!  thanks||@

Checking that now!   Was asurion needing that information if I may ask?   I completely understand Michele! I am researching into that as we speak!  Thank you so much for your patience!   I am trying to retrieve some information but it is not giving me anything. Do you happen to know roughly how long ago that had happened?   Ah ok! That may be why I wasn't seeing anything. I will double check! Thank you for your time Michele!   Sorry for the delay! We do not normally look up this information but I am doing what I can do get this date for you!  Thank you so much for your patience Michele!   Thank you for waiting! I see that the last time this line was used was around, 3/18. This is the last date I am seeing.   Are you still with me Michele?   I have not heard from you for a few moments.  Would you like me to keep this chat session open for you?

While I review your account to get better acclimated, please tell me a few details about how I may service you today.  That's current, Kimberly. You can bring your currently out of contract device to the new Verizon Plan or upgrade to a new device on a 2-year contract. Using the out of contract smartphone will save you $20/mo from your service.  I'm showing that for the 1 GB MORE Everything Plan you would pay $55/mo before taxes and surcharges are applied. For the 1 GB Verizon Plan you would pay $50/mo before taxes.  I just wanted to check in to make sure everything is going okay. I'm still here to assist if you like.

Thank you.||@I saw you have new plans I wanted to take a look at lowering my bill.  As you can see, I use less than 1 gig per month (I work from home and use wifi)  I'm out of contract and I understand the new plans are priced like you either buy the phone or you bring your own phone - no phone subsidies so the plans are cheaper?||@

I am here to help. What steps have you taken so far?  Okay; what is the mobile number were working with this evening?  Great; I truly appreciate all of the steps you  have taken so far. Let's see what we can do .  It will take just a minute or two to access your account.  While I?m doing that, how has everything else been going with your Verizon Wireless service?  Awesome. I see the problem.   The device that you are attempting to connect via the cable is not being recognized by the computer. In order to get the picture from your device to your computer we would have to use email or a memory card.  Look at you ""Congratulations"".  :-)  Okay. We are going to have to email the picture to yourself open it on the computer and then save it to the desktop.  It is just like sending a picture or text message; but instead of phone number you would enter an email address.  Let me review. You may be able to select more.  Just one minute.  Do you have Backup Assistant on the device now.  The basic phones are not compatible with the Cloud. Do you know if you saw an option for Back up Assistant plus?  This will back up your photos.  There's a difference. Yes. You would have to download VZ Contact transfer on the iphone. Or if your local store has a data transfer machine they may be able to assist with a media transfer.   Your right.   Yes on the iphone  it will be VZ Contact transfer.  Your welcome Geneva.   Back up Assistant plus transfer contacts, pictures and videos. When you download the application on your Iphone.   It?s my goal to provide excellent customer service to you.  Have I done that today?  You are very welcome.

If you go individual we can add the lines to single line plans with 1GB of data and unlimited talk and text and it would be $60 per line before taxes.

I will start the process of disconnecting the line. If you can hold for just a a moment please.   Yes that is correct Matt. There are no early termination fees, since the phone is out of contract.   You can do whatever you like with the phone.   Always good to have a spare phone incase anything happens to your current phone.   I appreciate your patience matt. I have processed the disconnect on that line. so after today, that line will be disconnected.   Will there be anything else I can assist with today?

My name is George, and I will be assisting you with all of your online account needs. How may I help you today?  I certainly understand. We can certainly review some options to help lower your monthly bill. To better assist you, let?s go ahead and pull up your account. May I have your full name and 10 digit mobile number, please?  Thank you so much for that information James! I see that you have been a customer since 2006! I would like to personally thank you for your continued loyalty! Please allow me just a few moments to review your account. How has your day been so far?  That's great to hear!  While I look into your account to see how we can help you save, may I ask how has your overall experience been with Verizon?  I certainly understand! We definitely want to ensure you maintain the best service at the lowest price possible. May I ask what is in your budget for phone services?  Were you looking to add an additional line?  May I ask what kind of phone it would be that you are adding?  Great! Do you already own the smartphone, or are you needing to purchase one?  No problem!  We do have some great plan options to get you close to your budget.  With your current 4 lines, you are averaging 0.820GB of data monthly.  You can move to our More Everything Unlimited Talk and Text 1GB shared data plan for $120 monthly. That way you are only paying for the data that you are using.  However, if you wanted more data, we get you on our 6GB plan for $140.  With you wanting to add an additional smartphone line to your account, on the 6GB plan, if you purchase that phone independently of Verizon, it would be $15 more. On the 1GB plan, it would be $25 more. At this time, you would not be able to have 5 lines with the current devices you have for $110 monthly.  To get a plan for $110 monthly, you would need 5 basic phones with 700 minutes. That plan would be $105.  You are very welcome.  I completely understand. What I can do for you is note your account of what we have discussed, so that if you do decide to change your plan, we can set you right up.  No problem at all James. May I ask if there is anything else I can help you with?  It has been an absolute pleasure assisting you tonight. Thanks again for chatting in with us today! If there is anything you need in the future do not hesitate to contact via Phone or Chat. Thanks for choosing Verizon Wireless. Have a great evening!||@I have been with Verizon for a number of years and have been happy with the service but would like to minimize my costs at this point.  I've been looking at another service that would suit our needs at about half the cost.  James Rhee  925-997-6110  Good  very good but expensive  I would like to get down to $110 for 5 lines.  yes  a smartphone  I'll probably pursue this on my own.  Thanks.  With a 5th line, would you be able to get it down to $110?  Okay, thanks for checking.  Sorry, but that wouldn't work for us.  I'll pass for now.  That's it.  You too.||@

Here online I can offer you a device that can be used like wifi, is that what you are looking for?  It would be 50mbps with the speed and with you trying to game I would start with a plan like 10gb for $80 monthly .  Yes it will show your usage on that device and it is $15 per gb overage.  Do you already have a account ?  May I have your full name ?  Can you verify the account password ?  I completely understand your concerns for needing this information off your account. That password you gave didn't allow me to access your account. The billing password can be up to 5 characters and it's what you verify when calling customer care. Would you like to try another?  Thank you/  You can add this device to your current account and it will share the data on the account .  You would need to increase your data plan.  Give me a moment .  You can get 20gb and pay $253.40 before taxes.  CLICK HERE  You would choose a jetpack device.  The 6620L device is the one that every customer chooses, it is the newer one and seems to move faster.  Those are only available for ship at this time]  Okay :) Have a nice night !  Thank you for being a valued Verizon Wireless Customer!

Okay now about the new accounts It was said that we as existing customers have the options to keep same plan type we have had already I never was under contract from two years ago just a contract agreement to pay off the Convoy III fliptop phone which Now is out of date as it won't accept e-mails I had awhile back an option to trade in the phone on the Convoy for Galaxy it was last month ago. Then this no account contracts came up inbetween the time I had to get to my local Verizon store in Medford Oregon 80 Miles away  Sounds like nice place so you a AZ D'Back or CO Rockies?  lol I don't like Hockey lol I am basically a baseball fan Giants and was one long before they started to win in west the series  They won as NY G's  and were the Gothoms  lol  Okay and there will be no change then even if I do go in and upgrade to the Galaxy S 6 Mini? other then 27.80 or so for payments on phone?  Okay My Dad's Therapist's assistant has same company and we were looking through the site trying to decipher it ourselves. I told her (because an Outlet was nasty to Her) to Go to an Actual Verizon Store which for us is in Medford Oregon. For some reason peopl in Valley don't know that Yreka is not a Verizon Store just an outlet. You have training for the company through it which is much better  So my Phone will be paid off in month then just see what I have for trade in value and keep same plan  as that was my texted offer  Thank you In all honesty You have been a great company except confussion when you bought PrimeCo in Texas and AirTouch in Bay Area. There was much confusion my parents lived in Texas at the time I was in college in California and they didn't know our contracrt was through Airtouch But that was forgiven.  Good because I use the cell for all long distances and here everything is long distance as we are 30 miles from nearest town and 80 miles from nearest city Medford Oregon out in stixx  I know the nearest one to us is in Medford Oregon We are 50 miles to border but it is mout Ashland lol  thank you  97501 is Medford and 96027  Etna is 96027  It use to be spelled Aetna like the insurance but people called it Ate-nah instead so they dropped the A  Yep and they are so nice there always busy servicing several communities  yes and they love to push this straight talk company and you don't ever want to miss a payment or be late with them at least you guys you can say hey I messed up i'm bit late and you work with us they charge late fees minute usage all kinds of stuff I heard a couplke going over their bill I thought guys just go with Verizon  Unfortunately Direct hooked up with ATT&T now I have them Direct it is like I am paying competitor I don't like and We have only Satelite in this area no cables  Yes can you get a good review for your help anywhere a survey?

I understand. I believe what you did is you future dated the change in your data plan to have it take effect on your next billing cycle. And that was the pending order you saw so if you want to change the effectivity date of the data plan change, you would indeed need to cancel this pending one.   Let us look at your account for this. I'm actually waiting for your profile to generate now so we can check that.   While waiting, could you please tell me how was your overall experience with Verizon so far? We just want to make sure that you're getting the best wireless service from Verizon.   Thank you for your feedback, we really appreciate it. I'll be sure to answer all of your questions for today so you'll have the same remarkable experience with us today.   I have the account on hand now and I'm currently reviewing your rate plan for eligibility.  Thank you for waiting.   Sorry for the long wait Karin, you had 6 lines and I wanted to make sure that I've checked each for eligibility and currently, only one line is under the Device Payment Program (formerly Edge) so it would be the only line qualified for the $20.00 access fee.   You could get the $80.00 data plan for 12 GB however the access fee for the other lines would remain the same.||@Question #1 - We had the $80 10GB plan but went over last month so we bumped it up to 15GB.  I came in nlast week and changed it back to 10Gb but the site was a bit confusing and it looks like it will only take effect in September.  I want it to take effect in August.  It says there is a pending order change (I assume the one I did) and I have to cancel it to make a change?  Can I do that and implement a change that applies for my august billing period?  OK -  Question #2 - I read that starting tommorrow you are changing plans and it looked like it was going to provide 12GB for $80 instead of the current 10GB.  Will I be eligible to get this new data plan?  It has been good.  The manager at our University Village store is most helpful.  I believe her name is Kozul (I may have the spelling wrong).  Its a bit of a wait...  Ok - thank you - I will stop by and take care of it at my local store.  Have a good evening / day!||@

Is this for the 1164.  Thank you! Just a moment more.  I'm doing my best to search for it. I'm not really seeing much other than it was started, but I'm trying to see the receipt you stated.  Is this in your My Verizon Documents and Receipts? I'm looking through our receipts in our system, so if you have it in there it may be faster if I view it form there rather than our full receipts.  It's in the documents and receipts as the equipment purchase. I did view it and after adding up all of the charges for all purchases made and the taxes, then removing the $145.00 trade-in value, that was the $643.81 total. So it looks like the trade-in was applied to the purchase to lower the costs.  $599.99+$40.00+$19.99+$9.99+$12.51+$29.99+$76.34=$788.81-$145.00=$643.81. I'm sorry if that wasn't what you were told, but you can see that it does add up.  Usually battery issues are relative to apps running in the background, grinding up all of the battery. You can usually go into the settings and view what the highest cause of battery usage is, as it may be relative to specific apps. The most recent update was 06/30/2015, with no current update showing, but you may try to use a search engine to find out more. I can't really give you information if it's not available directly to us, as that would be speculation based on theories (or ""leaked"" info sometimes, so can be accurate) which are not guaranteed.||@just checkin in.  I gave up on my Galaxy 5 after the last google update and bought an edge.  I was told I would get a credit to turn in my olde devise.  I have not seen it on my account and noted you just charged me for the next month.  Can you please advise?  See equipment purchase early July for detail on the receipt.  I was told it would appear as a credit on my bill.  yes  ok  im here.  have to leave in a little bit.  are you still there?  at bottom of purchase receipt it shows the credit amount.  but I havent seen it hit any invoice.

I understand that there's a $40 replacement charge, however it also seems that my monthly bill has increased as well?  I do not want to change anything on my current plan other than to order the FREE upgrade.  yes  Yes.  But it also indicates that my monthly cost is $180.  That's more than I'm currently paying I believe.  Okay.  thank you.  Do I pick it up at a store or will it be shipped?  OK  Thanks again. Enjoy your evening.  Said the order went through. No confirmation yet in email.  Yes I completed that page once. Do you want me to do it again?  Okay.  I'll wait here then.  I filled out that page twice.  yes.

Thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless Chat. My name is Jenn, How may I help you today?   I can surely give that a look Jean. The call was seen through My Verizon, correct?  Ok, let me bring that up. Also, if you have any other questions that I may assist you with, please feel free to ask away, I want to make sure that you don't have any other questions that go unresolved.   Ok, I'm checking out that call. It can be a few reasons why it's 000-000-0000  First, since it is the latest call registered, it can be the system's delay in capturing the full information of the call (the phone number).  Another possibility is it could've been come in as a ""private"" or ""blocked"" number.  Most of the time, it's the first option. The computer isn't as fast to capture the call information as the tower is.  Within 24 hours those 000-000-0000 will turn into an actual number.  It should Jean, unless the call was private or blocked, then it will remain at 000-000-0000  If it was an outgoing call and they used *67 before dialing the number, it will also show up as 000-000-0000  Within the 24 hours. By tomorrow you can see the word ""incoming"" or ""outgoing"" to verify if it came or went. If the number still shows up as 000-000-0000 is incoming, it means the person calling had their number blocked or private. If it was outgoing, then *67 was used.||@hi.. a call was made from my phone at 1:27 this afternoon.  the number showed as all 0s and I was wondering if you can find out what the number was that was dialed. the phone line is 774-836-5986  yes  ok then the number should show up tomorrow?  if the number is being blocked or private would it show that way if it was an outgoing call  or can it just be incoming  ok.. and is there any way of finding out if this is what happened  thank you||@

May I ask who I have the pleasure of providing world class service to?  Good evening! How may I assist you Harriet?  I'd be more than happy to assist you with that. What seems to be the problem?  Thank you for the information you provided! Please allow me just a few moments to research this issue for you!  Which device are you trying to back up?  Thank you!  What I am going to do is troubleshoot the device and see if we can get it fixed for you1  Thank you!  I am going to go through a few questions with you. Is that alright?  Is there any visible damage to the device?  Thank you for that information. Please allow me just a moment.  Thank you for your patience. I am looking further into the account to see what might be causing this.  Can you go into your settings and tell me if your WiFi is on?  Thank you. Have you tried stopping the back up assistant then restarting it?  Let's force stop it through the settings and see if that might fix this.  Can you select the bottom left button on the navigation bar?  When it pops up, please select Manage Apps.  Select running apps on the top menu bar.  Once you do that, select back up assistant.   Then select stop  Great! Can you try to start the back up again for me?  That's good!  Can you go back to the back up assistant and try to back up the device again.  Go into the back up assistant plus app.  Then continue like you were before.   Please let me know if it works or sends the same or different error.  Alright.  Go under your settings and try it that way.  Alright. Let's try turning the device off then back on.   I know this seems silly. However, it helps to determine the cause.  Great! Once it has restarted, can you go ahead and try it one more time.  No! Thank you! I understand how this must make you feel. You are being so awesome throughout it!  May I ask if you have tried backing it up through your Verizon Cloud?  To clarify, you are trying to use the Verizon Cloud app?  Thank you. I am looking into this further. I may need you to contact our technical support if the next steps do not work.  I certainly understand how you feel. I apologize for the inconvenience.  I am the first step of tech support.  There is a second level for if the issue can not be resolved with the steps we take.  Most of the time we get it fixed. However, your case seems very unusual as we can not figure out the issue.  I can provide you with the number to the second level.  They are still open.  When you say subscription are you referring a subscription to receive tech support?  The number is 1-800-922-0204 option 3.  With your current plan you are on offers 25GB of free storage on the Cloud.  You already have storage space. The app is just acting up.  I know I didn't solve the issue. Is there any other way I can assist you?  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to assist you today and for being the best part of Verizon! Everything I did go over can be found on verizonwireless.com and in My Verizon. Again my name is Amanda. Have a great week!||@hi there Amanda...this is Harriet nicotera  right back @ ya....thanx!

I see that you have been a customer with us since 2003, and I would personally like to thank you for your loyalty thus far.  You are more than welcome! :) I am very sorry to hear about the issues that he is having with his phone. I completely understand how frustrating it can be to have problems with your device. I recommend that you contact our Technical Support Team at 1-866-738-8609 or *611 from your handset and select Option 3. One of our Technical Support specialists will be happy to assist you with ordering his device through the warranty program at no charge to you all.   I want to be sure that he is able to get that device and get it as soon as possible. What I will do is go ahead and notate your account in full detail about this so that your call will be expedited and the next agent knows what's going on.  No, I do apologize. It must be done through Tech Support. May I ask if he has on old phone that he would like to activate in the meantime?  Wonderful! Do you feel as though I fully understood and took action to resolve all of your concerns today?||@Hi, my husband has been struggling with the battery life on his phone.  He has taken it in to the store a couple times and they have tried to fix it.  The last time they told him that they would just warranty it if it wasn't fixed. So I just need to get him a new phone coming through warranty.  It will say it is almost half charged and then in the next 10 minutes it will be dead.  When you plug it in to charge it, it come up right away that it is 20% charged.  Thank you!  Ok I can't do it on here?  Ok sounds good!   Thank you!  No!  I think it is just overnight. So he will be fine until then.  Absolutely!   Thanks so much!||@

Just one moment while I look into that for you.  Now Ann, Just to clarify. You said that your friend is receiving these notifications via email, or text message?  Thank you for that information.  No that will be quite alright Ann, thank you though. I am just checking to see if there is any reason on your account that these messages would be sent.  I see that you are set up for data usage alerts, but I am not seeing anywhere that these messages are going anywhere but to your personal email. Just to make sure that I touch all my bases Ann, can you give me your valid email address please?  Okay, thank you Ann.  It looks like unfortunately I am not able to find a reason as to why these emails are heading to your friends email address. What I would recommend is that you call our technical support team at 800-922-0204, and ask for tier II support. They should be able to get this straightened up for you.

Let me see what I can do. My condolences.  I do not have enough promotional minutes to cover it all, I am looking into increasing your plan for this month.  I do understand.  I am verifying that if I change the plan that you will be able to back.  I can change you to the 900 plan, and I will add promotional minutes so it will be covered.  This change will not affect the contract. I show I can add 50 additional minutes for free, no strings attached.  You can go back to the original plan, or change your plan completely. If you go off Nationwide, you will not be able to go back.  I show the Nationwide 900 is 59.99, so you will see a $20.00 increase in your next bill.  I have lost both parents, I know how stressful it can be.  I can make that change to begin at the start of your new cycle.  Yes. And although it gets better, it does not go away.  No, it will not.  No overage, the plan change and the promo minutes I added will cover all of it.  You will not.  Is there anything else I can help with?  Thank you for chatting with me, and being the best part of Verizon. If there is nothing else I can assist you with please click the End Chat button. Have a wonderful rest of your week!||@It show on my account that I have an overage of 400 plus minutes.  My mother passed away and was sick from 07/18/15 until her passing on July 25th.  Several calls were made during that time that would not have been normally made.  My billing period ends tomorrow is there any way that I can just increase my minutes for that billing period?  I do need to upgade but done one to make any quick decisions on what up grade I want.  thank you  Whatever you can do I would appreicate  I don't want to get caught in another 2 year contract with out upgrading.  What are promotional minutes?  How many are available.  OK, can I change the plan back or to another plan  Oh, you are wonderful! I have had so much going on lately.  How do I go back  Yes, it is and I have had to do everything by myself and there is so much left to do and then the part of missing her so much is alwasys there....  So the billing cycle that ends tomorrow will not have an overage  so I will have a large overage bill  Oh, I think I read this wrong you are saying that I will not have an overage.  Again, thankyou so much.  I will pass your kindness on to someone else.  Have a great evening  No you have been wonderful.||@

Firstly, thanks for chatting in with me today! I want to make sure that we do everything we can to assist you today to get all of your needs taken care of with checking the account with options to lower your monthly cost.   No worries! I can check the pricing if you switch to the 6gb plan and how much you would save compared to what you are currently paying.   Thank you so much for your patience, I just wanted to let you know that I am still reviewing your account for details. I will just be another moment.  Erin, if you lower your monthly cost to the 6gb plan with all the lines on the account your monthly cost would be $253.96 before the device payment on lines 3386, 3070, 0632, and 1325. With the device payment added to your monthly cost your monthly cost would be $314.36 before taxes. Right now you are currently paying $355.40 which you would saving $41.04 with the plan change to the More Everything 6gb plan.  With the device payment the line access fee is reduced from $40 to $15 per line that is enrolled in the device payment. For the smartphone line that are not enrolled in the device payment the line access fee is $40.   Yes that are enrolled in the device payment program. For the tablet lines on the account the line access fee is $10 per line.   Yes that is correct with the new  plan we are releasing the 12gb plan will be $80.  It would not extend the contract on the line but you would be changing the plan allowance   You will keep the same contract on the lines but you would be changing the data allowance on the plan.  Yes that is correct!  Awesome! Let me get the plan changed to the 6gb plan.   The contract on the tablet will not renew unless you renew the contract on the line. Once the contract end that line will remain out of contract.   :)  Erin, Order Reference Number: 100000000001205235 has been created successfully. The plan has been changed to the More Everything 6gb plan. The new plan will be effective on 08/29/2015.  You're welcome! I do see that you have been with us for a few years now Erin! We are definitely glad to have you as part of the Verizon family and we certainly appreciate you being a valued customer! If you don't mind, we would like to know how your overall experience has been in that time?  Hey, I just wanted to check in and make sure that everything is going okay. I am still here to assist you if you would like.  Awesome!

Thank you for being part of the Verizon Family!||@Trying to see about options to lower my bill  I was speaking with someone earlier and he advised to drop to 6gb would lower by $108 a month...that does not seem to be a correct figure  Ok  Ok thanks  The device payment is the 40 less the eedge discount of $35 for each line  So all phones are 15 bucks  Ok so if we start to use data can we then increase the data again...isn't it now 80 bucks for 12gb  So if we had to change to more data we could it would just extend our contract out?  What does that mean?  O ok..so the worse that would happen is we get more data for the same price? We currently are getting 10gb for 80...so if we had to change we would be getting 12gb for 80  Awesome...so let's lower it!  To the 6gb  Can u note to non renew the tablet that expires this month or will I have to call?  Terrific!  Are we all set then? Thanks for all ur help!!  Great! I also have my residential service with Verizon so I am going to see if they can offer me any promotions for my cell phone as I used to get $10 off each phone line  What will the new bill be?  Ok great!||@

I'll be able to go over any questions you may have today regarding ETF fees. I'm pulling up your account to assist you!  I'm showing you have 8 lines on the account, I'm pulling up the ETF fees for the lines. May I ask the reason you are wanting the ETF fees?  I'm sorry to hear you are thinking of leaving Verizon. Is there a reason you are considering changing your service?  Right now I'm showing all but one line is on a contract. The ETF would be $1430 for the lines on the account  no problem, Gregory. Line ending in 9596 is $330.00. line 4574 is $165.00, line 4696 is $165.00. Line 5234 is $165.00, line 5355 is $165.00, line 7202 is $220.00 and line 7203 would be $220.00 as well.  The original line will remain on a contract until the contract end date, what is allowed is to transfer upgrades only at this time.   I did an account analysis and show that since line 6543 is not under a contract currently, you can receive a $25.00 off per month discount as part of a promotion we have.  I just apply the promotion and line 6543 will get $25.00 off every month until the line upgrades.  It is a line access promotion for phones not on a contract.  No commitment at all, no contract. The only thing required to keep the promotion is for you to keep the device on that line.  I'll just apply that discount, one moment please, Gregory!  Ok i have finished adding the $25.00 off promotional discount. That will remain on your account as long as you keep the phone on line 6543.  Besides the discount, Gregory I show you are on the best plan for your data needs. Starting tomorrow however we will offer the New Verizon Plans. If you change your line to the new Verizon plan, the 12GB plan will be the same price as your current 10GB plan of $80.00 but you will get an additional 2GB of data. All contracts will remain the same.  You can keep your current More Everything plan of 10GB for the same price as that will be a grandfathered plan. The new Verizon Plans have a Small Plan for 1GB, Medium Plan 3GB, Large Plan 6GB and an XL Plan 12GB for $80.00  I have not heard from you for a few moments.  Would you like me to keep this chat session open for you?  that will be $60.00 for the Large 6GB plan. The Medium 3GB plan will be $45.00  you can log in to myverizon and do a plan change, you can chat with us and get on the new plan, or call us at our customer service number, Gregory.  if the tablet is on a 2 year contract the ETF is determined by the type of tablet purchased and each month the tablet is on the contract a certain percentage of the ETF is reduce.  ok so the ETF was originally $175.00. starting on month 7 of the contract each month is reduced an additional $5.00  Awesome to hear Gregory !  I'm glad we were able to give you information regarding ETF and discounts today.  Thank you for being a loyal Verizon customer since 2007!  When you are ready to say bye to me, please click on the ""End Chat"" button.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day and please take care!||@Can you please tell me what the current ETF is for each line is on my account?  considering changing my service  $$$  Can you tell me what it is for each line?  Can I transfer a contract between lines?  ok what is the promotion?  how does it work?  Theres no commitment on my end?  ok how do I set it up?  ok, thanks  But what will be the new price of the 10GB plan?  How much will the 6GB plan be?  ok.  do I just log on tomorrow and change my plan?  ok one last question...  how is the ETF for the tablets calculated?  all of our tablets are on 2-year contracts and they're all the ellipsis 8  ok got it.

Alright, so I'm not currently seeing any early upgrade options available for that line, but the you can check back in about a month or so to see if any early upgrade options are available at that time.

As you can see, you purchased your new ""iPhone 4S"" online and you also paid $45.00 for the plan, we need to transfer your new iPhone and those $45.00 from this account into the other one that has the phone number that you wish to keep using.  In the chat department we are not able to transfer those $45.00 to the other account but don't worry, I will provide you with the department that is able to do it for you.  First I will make the notes on both accounts explaining all this and then I will provide you with the number of the other department, they should be able to transfer the phone and those $45.00 into this account: ""518-225-0326""  Please allow me a moment while I do the notes for both accounts.  Thank you very much, the notes has been made, the other agent will need to verify the other account to transfer the phone and $45.00 into the account that you wish to use, first we need to create a security code for ""518-491-5067""  Please provide me with 4 number, that will be the security code for ""518-491-5067""  Thank you very much, the note and the code was updated, now I will provide you with the department that will do the rest for you.  Please get in contact with this department: ""888-890-3721"" and tell them that you wish to do a device swap and you wish to transfer the phone and $45.00 to the account that you wish to use.  Tell them that you wish to transfer the phone and $45.00 from this account ""518-491-5067"" into this one ""518-225-0326""  Also tell them to read the notes on both accounts, I've already explained all this in the notes, you have nothing to worry about.||@need to keep same phone number for another phone I just got.

I hope that you are having a great day!  Allow me one moment please to get your account pulled up so that I can better assist you.  While I am reviewing over the account, may I ask how your overall experience has been with Verizon Wireless?  I have reviewed over the account and you wouldn't be able to purchase an additional 60 minutes, but you are able to increase to the next allowance which would be 1400 minutes. The overage fee would be $0.45/per ever 1 minute that you go over.  Allow me one moment please and I will double check to see if 800 numbers count against your minute allowance.   I have further researched this for you and 800 numbers do count against your minute allowance.  If you were to cancel your contract, your Early Termination fee would be $370.00 total for both devices, plus the remaining balance due for the monthly bill.   I?m sorry to hear you?re thinking of leaving us. We really appreciate your business and I?m sure together we can find a solution that keeps you as a valued VZW customer  I have reviewed over the account and the data usage and based off of your current data usage. I would suggest staying with your current plan because you average around 20.11GB of data and the 3260 line currently has the Unlimited Data option.  If you were to change plan you would no longer have the Unlimited data option.||@I have 31 minutes left of my 700 monthly plan. I still have 3 days left in the billing cycle. Is there a means of purchasing say 60 minutes for just this month? What are the charges once I exceed 700 minutes?  I'm thinking of changing due to my monthly bill being high. My ""plan"" is for a shared 700 minutes, which usually is no big deal, but since I'm relocating to Albq, NM, its the only phone I'm using and for the relocation, I've used it a lot this month. I only have 6 GB which is okay for me, but there seems to be so many other carriers out there offering more for less.  I understand that the minutes don't count Verizon mobile to Verizon mobile, but what about 800 numbers?  Yeah, it was all that time spent with Comcast on the phone trying to get service here. My contract end date is 2/27/16. Can you tell me what the remaining amount is for my phone?  Its just the monthly bill at $179. I will need to see if there is anything out there for less monthly charges.  Okay thanks....||@

Can you verify the password on the account for security please?  Thank you Alen! What are the last 4 numbers of your wife's line ?  Thank you.   You transferred the upgrade from the line ending in 8673 today?  Okay, after checking your account, I am showing that you are able to upgrade and transfer the upgrade. Are you upgrading with a 2yr contract today?  Hmm. You stated that you are wanting to go with the Note 4 correct?  I would recommend the device payment option. Your device will be $26 monthly and the line access fee will be $15 for that line making it $41 monthly and you will only have to pay the taxes on the device today.   What you can do, being that it is giving you slight trouble is to upgrade the device on the original line and then activate it on the line that you want when you receive it if it is not allowing you to go through with the order.   The only thing with doing it this way is that the payments will show on the line ending in 8673 but the device will be on the 4679 line.   Hi, I'm just checking in. How is everything going?  Absolutely! I can check for you now.   I have it available at the Porter Ranch location. You can order your devices online, skip all the paper work and store lines, go right into the store and pick up your devices a hour after you order. How does that sound?  Let me double check.   It is showing me that there is one available at the Porter Ranch location and the Northrige loation.   :) Welcome  Thank you for being a valued Verizon Wireless Customer!

I thought about that, but wasn't sure if that would cause issues.  OK, I'll see about that. Maybe I'll just go to a store (if I can find it in stock) and just take care of it there. Our local store did not have the white in stock. Do you have a way of checking near zip code 91326?  That's where I was an hour ago. They said they're out. Weird  White Note 4, right?

Nice to meet you Aaron :) and I am sorry to hear about your battery also :(  Me too! :) and Aaron I did see that you are not the account owner and that is why it is not allowing you to view the receipts.

You are very welcome and make sure they assign an account owner when you call :)   Have a wonderful day!! :) Thank you for chatting with me today and being a valued Verizon customer.

They start officially tomorrow!   If you upgrade at the 2 year contract discounted price the monthly line access fee would be $40.00.   If you switched over to the device payment option you would end up paying the full retail price of the device over 24 monthly installments with a monthly line access fee of $20.00.  With the device payment option you would not be under contract.   You can do it only for one line if you would like.   That is for the whole account the data would be shared.   Do you have any further questions or concerns I may assist you with?  You would not be required to switch but if you did you would only pay $63.00 for the 12GB data plan. I did not see your employee discount earlier.   Thank you Kelsey for being a valued Verizon Wireless customer since 2007!!! Again my name is Clifford and if you have no further questions you can click the ""END CHAT"" button located at the top right of this screen when you are ready to say goodbye.||@Hi I saw where you all were switching plan types  I have one line eligible for upgrade and I'm trying to deicde if it would be better for me to stick with the 2-year contract or switch to a new plan type  I'm just having trouble figuring out the price difference  we would be upgrading from an iphone 5 to an iphone 6  cool. and can i do that for one line on my account and leave the others the way they are, or do all lines have to become part of the ""new"" plans  awesome! I saw these price tiers listed in an NBCnews article: Then, customers choose from one of the following four data packages:  Small: $30/month for 1GB of shareable data Medium: $45/month for 3GB of shareable data Large: $60/month for 6GB of shareable data X-Large: $80/month for 12GB of shareable data  is that per line, or per account?  great. so if we currently pay $78 for the 15 GB and we switch one line to the new plan, we will still have the option to continue with that data plan or will we have to change to the 12 GB at $80?  ah! forgot about the discount :)  thanks so much for your help! your answers were very helpful!||@

I would be happy to answer any questions you may have, but first may I ask who do I have the pleasure of chatting with today?  May I ask if you are a new customer or an existing one looking to upgrade?  I understand, May I ask what page are you on?  May I ask how many lines did you have?  May I ask which phone did you add to your cart?  Then that would be around $92 without taxes, So I do not see where you saw the $39 from  Yes you would see the taxes up front, so that might be the $39.  The next few steps after the cart page is just filling out personal information, so let me know if you run into any issues and I would be happy to help you resolve them.  Just to clarify, It is asking you for your personal information?  Then go ahead and fill out the information and I will try to resolve any problems, Or I would be happy to answer any questions you may have for me today.  Just checking in, how is everything going?||@hey dustin..i was trying to order a new phone online and it said I had to put 130 down instead of the normal $39  newq  sorry for typos  well, not sure..it was when i was checking out  i just need a single line  i am currently with at &t  the iphone 6  yes...a month  but when ordering a new phone i should only be paying the taxes? right  thats what i meant  its asking me to pay 130  ok..that s what its asking me  yes||@

Let me take a look here to see if that message came through here for me   Ah, ok. Looks like I do have that message and we need to go ahead and get your global plan removed. I am getting your account pulled up now and we'll go from there!   Excellent. Looks like your number is the one ending in 3095 and you were setting up the plan for $40, is that right?  Alrighty. What were the dates that you were on the trip?  Gotcha, ok. Since the plan wasn't actually active during that time, the usage will actually be billed as pay as you go. It may be better to go ahead and backdate the plan for you to cover the trip and then I can set it up to fall off at the end of the cycle. That way any usage you incurred would be fully covered over the plan for the one charge of $40 on the next bill.   On my end, I'm showing 8 minutes and one text so far but it will take some time for it to fully report to us. With just that usage showing so far though it's at $14.37. If no other usage is reported, that will be perfect. I will go ahead and remove the order for the 7th for you!   Ok, that's all set!   No problem!

I am going to review your account so that we can get to the bottom of this!  I would be concerned as well,  I will do everything I can to get this resolved today!  No problem give me just a moment to pull up your account please.  Which line is in question tonight?  Ok  I have some news for you will can cancel this line without you having to pay a early term fee if you would the way we can do it is called a line reduction were we take the number you have out of contract and port in over there number you have in contract and you phone number that you want to keep will take over the contract of the phone you are trying to get rid off therefore you will not have to pay the early term fee.  We can cancel should say sorry about grammar was typing fast.  I hope that made sense my grammar was off but we can get the line canceled without a early term fee having to be paid.  If you are interested in that I can tell you how to do it?  Well no your 7583 number will take over the contract for your line ending in 7979 which will come out of contact on 11/22/2015 so you will be in contract for a couple months but you will save having to pay the 75.00 early term fee this is just a options I wanted to let you know about in case you did not know already.  75.00 a month plus tax just your current plan price for your smart phone number.  Ok what you will need to do is call *611 to get this done it will start today but it will have to be done by a rep over the phone because they have to call are core department to do what is a called a on demand disconnect but I can remark the account so they know exactly what you are calling for and be ready to help you.  I can make adjustment to current bill no problem and they can fix it to were your bill will be correct going forward just give me a few mins to note your account so they know what you want you call *611  You can call anytime just give me a moment to set it up by noting your account.  Ok I have noted account clearly how to do this when you call in just tell rep to look at chat rep remarks Tony call in a hr or when you have time they will get this done for you.  Were there any other concerns I could address for you today?  I am crediting charges also now.   Yes you can call no.  Yes you can call now I mean.  Credit for line for this month has been applied you can see that on your bill now.  Bill is now 82.88 instead of 97.88 call in and rep will do line reduction for you.  Well you will have to chat in at that time when the bill comes out to see if you have occurred any charges.  It was a pleasure assisting you. My goal was to provide you with a fantastic experience, would you be able to say I accomplished that?  Thank you for being the most important part of Verizon Wireless. You are truly a valued customer and we appreciate your business. Have a great night.||@I went to the Verizon Store to cancel one of my phone and I agreed to pay the early termination fee but I still get a bill and still paying for the phone.  I was not able to pay while I was there and that it will be on my next bill.  Shouldn't it be porated?  Thanks.  586-212-7979  So the 2127979 will be cancled as of today with no early termination fee? There will be no extended contract for the 8997583 phone and I can cancel it anytime I chose with out a Cancel fee correct.  So what will my bill be total until 11/22/2015  That would work  when will this start today or next period  We would like this to start on this bill that is due august 16th.  Can I call in an hour or do I need to call now  Can i call now or no?  Oh ok thanks.  My other concern was I was taking a drive in Algonac, Mi.  On the other side was Canada.  I received a text that I was on roaming charge.  I am hoping I don't get charges since I was not on the Canada side.  It happened to me before.  Ok.  Thanks again.  Yes you did!  Good night||@

(10 Extremely Helpful, 0 Not Helpful at All)*||@10||@Based on your most recent chat with Verizon Wireless, did the last representative you chatted with fully understand and take action to resolve your concern?*||@10||@||@||@Good evening.  I'd be happy to look at your billing with you. Please allow me a moment to bring up your account. Thanks.  I'm reviewing your current statement now.  Can you tell me a little more about the discrepancy you're seeing?  I see that your standard monthly charges and the monthly device payment are approximately $136.00.  With regard to taxes and fees, those are levied by your local and state agencies.  It's very difficult for agents to give exact quotes on final billing due to this. But let me see what we can do to get your bill down.  You're welcome. The wiggle room that I have to work with is your data plan. I'm also looking to see if perhaps we have any bonus data options as well.  You're welcome. So how are things going this evening?  Good to hear. And have we already looked into possible employee discounts for you through your employer?  Ah, I see.  One thing I can do to help with losing the 1GB of data by moving from 3GB to the 2GB plan is to offer you 500MB of bonus data per month for the next 12 months.  That's a $90.00 value.  You would save $10.00 per month on your account.  That's $10.00 total.  I understand. Yes, you can move up and down the various data plans we offer depending upon your needs. The current pricing will be changing tomorrow due to a new plan structure. I can't release details, but it will be on our website.  I can process the change now to the 2GB plan, but it wouldn't hurt to wait 24 hours to see the new pricing and see if it fits your needs.  At any rate I can put on the bonus 500MB of data for you.  That's free.  I'm working on it now for you.  It's likely a different offer. Can you describe the offer you received?  I see. That does sound perfectly in line for our trade in programs. I can look at our latest promos to see what's active but I cannot retroactively grant an extra discount.  Unfortunately, no.  But we did get you that 500MB of bonus data and we'll be able to check out that new pricing tomorrow.  Indeed. The free Verizon Cloud storage is quite simple to use. Let me get you the FAQ for that.  Here's a great overview of Verizon Cloud and how to use it: http://www.verizonwireless.com/support/how-to-use-verizon-cloud/?lid=sayt&#38;sayt=verizon%20cloud*  There would be an activation fee of $40.00 for the new device you choose.  Though let me check as you're on a device payment plan. In those cases the fee is waived.  I do show that both devices are on device payment plans, so that fee would indeed be waived.  That would be a restocking fee. Let me see what that is now.  My pleasure.  I show the fee to be $35.00. Let me check on the exceptions.  The exceptions require that Apple devices still be unopened and in original shrink wrap, so I don't believe that applies in this case, correct?  Hm. Have the devices been used at all?  I see. 16GB is indeed pretty small these days.  That is correct as it's a restock of the old device.  It wouldn't be of benefit if you're going to return it within 14 days. There's also no interest charged on the device agreements, so early pay off is if you're interested in owning the device outright earlier than 24 months.  Let me take a look at this for you.  Sorry for the delay there. Had another issue at hand.  With the device payment agreement, the pay off has to be in a lump sum. Paying extra per month isn't an option.  But you can pay that lump sum at any time you like.  No, it's just the full retail price of the device.  There's the restocking fees of $35.00 per device.  There's nothing else unless the devices aren't in good working order.  If there's damage, you'd pay the full retail price for them.  It was my pleasure.  Was there anything else I can help with?

Im not sure if he used some special offer to get me that rate  because honestly i dont know how much data we need, i came from unlimited paying 35$ a month  the only reason i switched to you guys is because i can pay out the iphone that i needed for work  i had boost mobile, so you can imagine this is a big jump for me  so if you were me would you make a change now or wait until tommorrow  ok, yes please do  i also noticed that your homepage says 300 for a trade in and I only got 200 for mine, is that correct or is that on a different plan or something  ok i will wait  to be honest the guy wasnt real clear, on my recepit it shows 'recycled device Value : 200.00  ok, so basically i cant get any additional credit - no way around it as far as the trade in goes  ok  now can you tell me how i can figure out how to use cloud storage the guy said something about verizon gives me some cloud storage?  thanks for that  ok, thanks  ok  one more thing, actually two  if we want to change phones within the 14 day period what would the charge be besides the additional cost of the device?  and the guy said something about a fee for bringing back a phone or something?  ok, thanks  ok  he took the shrink wrap off at the store lol  yes they have been, I am only asking because my daughter just got the 16 gb i think and we are considering upgrading hers  to more memory  yes it seems like updates are all so big  so in the case if i upgrade her i would pay the 35$ fee right  ok  and if I want to pay a phone off early, is that to my advantage or disadvantage in any way?  as far as early pay off charges or monlthy interest of any sort  ok, or if i just get some extra money and want to reduce my monthly bill  ok, well thank you for your help. I will check back tomorrow for my options on monthly plans. Just out of curiousity, if i said tomorrow i wanted to be done with it all since im within the 14 days what would happen?  if i wanted to terminate service and return the phones  its doubtful but just curious  ok  ok  does the lump sum end up being more than if you add up the monthly for 24 months?  ok  so what are the terms of returning the device and cancelling service within the initial 14 day period  thats all?  i doubt i would, just wanting to know  ok  gotcha  well thank for answering all my questions  no, that is all||@

Happy Wednesday!  I would be more than happy to take a look into that for you! Just allow me one moment to access your account information  Thank you very much!  I do see that you are on one of our older plans that are now called, ""Grandfathered."" What you could do is move to our MORE Everything plan. Would you like me to tell you a little more about that?  Yes, it would. I would also be more than happy to tell you about the MORE Everything Plan! Do you feel 3GB would be enough data for you per month?  Okay, awesome! The 3GB plan is $50.00. The 4GB plan is $60.00. You would then have a monthly line access charge of $40.00, that could be dropped to only $25.00 once your contract ends. You would have unlimited talk and text, and would be able to text internationally for free!  No, you would not have to extend your contract!  Your monthly line access fee would be $40.00, plus the price of whatever data package you chose. However, your contract ends on August 21, 2015. That would put you on a month to month basis, which would make your line access fee only $25.00  Any data overage would be $15.00 per GB  I completely understand. Your employee discount is showing that it was validated today. That would be 12% of your whatever plan you are on.  So, with your current plan you will save $7.80 once the discount is applied  Honestly, if you were to switch to the 4GB MORE Everything plan, you would be paying $100.00 before taxes and surcharges, versus what you are paying now. So, it is really up to you. I do see that you do not typically use much data. I would say sticking with your current plan is best for you  You are so very welcome! Was there any other questions or concerns that I could assist with today?  Great! You are welcome! You have been awesome! I truly enjoyed chatting with you. Again, my name is Katrina. I hope you have a wonderful evening! Whenever you are ready to say goodbye to me, just click on ""END CHAT."" Goodbye! :)||@I would like to increase the data on my account but I only have 1GB or 2GBs as an option  thank you and Happy Wednesday to you as well  Yes. Please tell me more about that. I also just logged my employer discount would that apply to this MORE Everything plan?  Either 3GB or 4GB  I would extend my contract?  So what is the $40 to $25?  Oh I see... so what will my overage charge be if I go over my current data?  And what will my employer discount be on the new plans?  I am trying to figure out if it will be a good idea for me to switch now or not  I am at 90% of my data with 14 days left  So is there an advantage to me switching to a new plan right now? Or just pay the $15 data overage fee?  Ok. I will do that then. Thank you!  No. That answered the questions that I had.  Thank you again.||@

We don't want you to experience inconvenience and I am here to make sure this will be the last time you'll worry about the global plan.   I am now pulling up your account for review..   You're welcome! How's your day?   You deserve a great day, Leo. Mine's going great as well, thanks for asking! :)   As per checking it here, the reason it's still showing is because the global plan was future-dated to be removed at the end of your cycle.   Would you want us to make this effective today rather than waiting on the end of your cycle?  Thank you for letting us know about this so we can take action. I'll now go ahead and make sure we backdate this here for you.   While doing this, I also see here you've been with us since 1999. Amazing! I just want to check how's your overall experience been with Verizon wireless?   Your feedback is much appreciated! Just making sure you're happy with the service.   Allow me a minute or two to make sure we do this correctly for you..   Thanks!   Waiting for the system to save this..   Now done. Yay! Now you're sure free form the global plan.   Make sure to refresh the page or log out then log back in the website so you'll also see the changes and it's now removed on your account.   Yay! We're a great team today.   Have we resolved the concern to your satisfaction? Anything else I missed?     I totally understand how saving is important and the system allowed us to remove this on the start date of your current cycle.   Let's try doing that again if it's okay with you, Leo. You're doing the right thing managing your account.   The change may take a few minutes but rest assured it's now deleted here.   Yep, refreshed your account here and it's not showing here anymore. :)   I also see here your plan is 20GB with $140 base charge. Verizon is coming out with a 20GB w/ $120 base charge so stay tuned online. :)   Oh, it's great that you are updated with the changes, Leo. I see here that some lines on this account are under Edge, right? Rest assured device payment/edge upgrade is still available.   If you want to stay on your More Everything plan, you definitely can! :)  Absolutely, employee discount helps a lot.   Thanks for giving me the chance to help today, Leo. I hope I'm lucky enough to assist you again via chat!  Have we addressed everything? Anything else I missed?  Thank you for chatting with me today and being the BEST part of Verizon Wireless.

I recently upgraded my phone, but my older phone (it was also through Verizon) is damaged. Is that phone still covered under Wireless Phone Protection or Total Equipment Coverage?  or is it just my current phone that would be covered  ok great, makes sense. thank you!  2nd question... do both Wireless Phone Protection and Total Equipment Coverage (I have both on this account) cover phones under the EDGE contract? or are there limitations there?  it's ok!  ok  ok great. thank you!  i think that's it  thanks very much for the help!||@

It is my husband's phone, and if you view the account activity, you will see he has not used it in many months.  It used to be very inexpensive to have a second line on the plan, but when I looked recently I saw we were being charged $30/month (before fees, taxes, etc.) for a phone that is not used.  It is the one that starts with 410-404  What is a month to month discount?  No, I think I just want to discontinue service for that phone.  No thank you.  Do you need more info from me?

I just wanted to check in to make sure everything is going okay. I'm still here to assist if you like.  I do apologize but I do not see that you are eligible for the $15 line access fee. That is for the device payment plan. You can still switch to the 10GB for $80. I can also check and see if there are any discounts that can lower you bill.  I understand John! I am looking to see if there are any discounts that will lower you monthly cost.  No problem!   I can reduce line 2414 $40 line access fee by 10% for 12 months.  Would you like for me to add that discount?||@Can I switch to the advertised plan which is 10 GB Data for $80.00, and $15.00 per phone?  Thanks  Very good...but with other, less expensive plans out there (also offering to buy out our Verizon contract), it has been tough to not take them up on it.  Hopwever, with this program (if eligable), there would be no need to change.  Looking to lower our monthly costs...  Thanks  Thanks!||@

No worries Betsy :D and in the video, it tells you how long the video is  If you play the video on your phone, it will tell you how long the video is  No, don't worry about deleting anything  Just try playing the video and tap the screen while it's playing, that will tell you how long the video is  4 minutes and 41 seconds?  Thank you Betsy, now it seems that video file is too large to be sent  You would have to find an app to cut the video in sections to be able to send it  you have the google play store app correct?  You can search in the app store for a ""video editor"" app  Now, guiding you would be out of my scope of support Betsy  You mean it won't send?  It's because the higher the quality, the larder the video is. Normally, in order for a video to be send would have to be around 1-10 megabytes   I'm afraid not, sending the video has nothing to with the size of the video  basically it cuts the video into smaller videos so they can be sent  Good, now that app should come with steps||@this is betsy ,don't know if you can help im trying to figure out how to do something  I took a video to send to someone and when I tried to send it to someones phone it said to send it to their email and I tried and I got the same message  it says too large  CANT I DO IT THROUGH A CHAT  HI THAT WAS QUICK  I TRIED TO SEND A VIDEO TO ANOTHER PHONE NUMBER AND IT TOLD ME IT WAS TOO LARGE TO SEND THROUGH AN EMAIL I TRIED THAT AND I GOT THE SAME MESSAGE  HOW DO I TELL  SORRY IM DUMB ABOUT STUFF  what do you mean d  do u  do I have too much stuff on here I need to delete some photos  441  441  yep  like what app  I also have a 19sec video and that wont work either  yep  why didn't the short one work either  no got the same message, how long can they be  if I delete stuff will I be able to do it  what is video editor  I downloaded it think its trim video||@

Hope you are having an AWESOME Wednesday! How can I be of assistance today?  The Loyalty Single Line Plan you currently have is part of the More Everything Plan, which wont take on any new prices  So your current plan is still available as long as you stay on this plan, I will find out if it will also be grandfathered, one moment  Ok, yes the More Everything Single Line Plans will also be grandfathered tomorrow, so if you switch from this plan, you wont be able to go back to it  Grandfathered means that the plans have been discontinued, so they will no longer be offered as a plan choice.If you are still on the plan, then you wont be removed.The only restriction I have seen is that eventually you wont be able to upgrade your line with a 2 year contract, only a device payment plan. The new plans will be released without the option to upgrade with a 2 year contract, only device payment.  So you should be able to upgrade one more time with a 2 year contract.  Yes, I can make the calculations for you. One moment please  New Plan 3GB - $30.00Line Access Fee $40.00 - $20.00 Device payment discount = $20.00Device payment - $27.15 (for iPhone 6, 16GB)Total = $77.15 before taxes and features  With your Mobile Protection Feature, the total would be $87.15  Certainly  Are there any other questions or concerns you have for me today?

How long has it been since they were switched over?  Ok.  How long has it been having text issues?  Oh, wow, that a long time for it not to be working.  Is it making calls OK?  I'm just going to look around on the account and see if something is stopping it from working properly.  Can you verify the SIM that is in that device for me?  That line isn't showing one active on it currently.  It would be under the batter if it has one. You would have to turn it off first.  Oh wait!   I found the issue.  You have a text block on that line.  I'm going to remove it and see if that fixes the issue.  I will. Just one moment.  How has your week been so far?  Alright, Yoni, I remove that block form the line. I just need you to restart the phone and then try to send out a text.  Everything is working Ok with it?  The $25.00 off is for a line that is outside of contract or is under device payments.  Currently your line is getting a $10.00 off discount. If the line is upgraded under a two year contract it will go up to $40.00.  If you did a device payment it would get the $25.00 discount, but you would pay monthly for the device.  No. It will give you the $25.00 for choosing to do the payments. But the line price would increase by the payment amount. What phone are you thinking of upgrading to?||@Hi there. I recently switched my land line and call phone number. My 602.885.7510 number is not receiving nor can it send text messages.  I'd like to fix that  maybe two or three weeks  since i switched  yea  It used to be a land line so I'm guessing that has something to do with it  ok  hmm  i didnt know there were sim cards  It is active I get phone calls  can we take that off  let me know when to try  Great thanks.  got it  thank you  yep, quick question. If I upgrade this to a smart phone will my bill go down? since it says save $25 off each smart phone with more everything plan  If I do the monthly payments on a phone it will go down if the cost of the device is less than 25$ ?  None, that's all the info I needed  thanks!||@

I have upgrades on all 3 lines and I would possibly upgrade on one or 3 but needed some info  I am currently grandfathered into the unlimited everything and would not want to change that. I want to upgrade to the iphone 6plus either by upgrade or buying a phone in payments if possible but not touching my current plan  Ok, that's all I needed to know  I will not be doing any sort of upgrade.  I have spoke to a few Verizon customers and they have told me that they have upgraded and their plan did not change  I don't understand how some are honored to upgrade and others are told different  ok. but some friends of mine have done it and I have witnessed it  but it's fine. I think Verizon needs to do a better job being consistent and fair with everyone  You don't understand, I would appreciate if you could relay that message to your supervisor  Thank You and have a good evening||@

How are you doing today?   I'm so sorry to hear that, Loriann! I can definitely look into this and help you out! I do see that your contract expires as of today, so the insurance has been covering this line up until tomorrow, but I can remove the feature today for you so that you do not have to worry about chatting in tomorrow when your contract ends to have it removed, is that alright?   No problem! I'll get that feature removed for you right now! I would like to thank you, as well, for being a part of the Verizon family since 2001 while I'm at it!   Yes, we are! We have a new plan coming out tomorrow that will offer you plans in the form of sizes. Based on your current usage, I would recommend our Small package with 1GB for $30.00 per month. You can then have the line access for $20.00 per month (since your line is out of contract very soon), and if you choose to upgrade, you can do so on our device payment plan so that you do not have a contract obligation for two years. :)   Do you have any ideas as to what type of phone you'd be interested in? I could give you a quote using that device price per month, as well.   We do have an iPhone 5C which is a newer iPhone, it comes in white, pink, blue, yellow or green and it has 8GB of memory, so it wouldn't be too different from the current phone you have. This would be $18.74 per month on the device payment plan, so your total would be estimated at $68.74 per month before taxes if you decided to upgrade your line to the 5C.   I actually have a 5C, it is very durable, but I recommend using a case with it for extra protection. However, we do have a 5S, if you prefer that, it would be $22.91 per month on the device payment plan. The total quote would be $72.91 per month before taxes with a 5S, or $77.08 per month before taxes with the 6 at $27.08 per month for the device payment. :)   Definitely! The iPhone 6 is a beautiful phone, too, but it's still perfect for basic use.   That sounds good to me! What do I use in terms of devices or a provider?   I've had an iPhone 5C in blue since it came out, and I just very recently swapped up to an iPhone 6 last week. :) Haha, and I do actually, honestly, use Verizon.   My sincere pleasure! I was so happy to help you out with this today! Whenever you're ready to say good-bye to me, please click ""END CHAT"", at the top right hand side of this window. I hope you have an amazing day and thank you once again for being a valued part of the Verizon family!||@I'd like to cancel my insurance... it is my undertanding that because of the version/age of my phone it really does nothing for me now and quite frankly I am upset that as a provider i was never notified as suxh  such  hello emmy!  by and i have been a very loyal customer... been with verizon since my first phone/service  that would be great  can you also tell me about my options moving forward.. i have seen in the news that y'all are doing away with contracts and subsidizing phone costs...  that there is a small medium, large,.. type of plan with installments for a phone upgrade/purchase  i have to be honest, i am not that techy and dont really care about being with the cool kids... i mainly use my phone as a phone, some soical media checks and browsing but like a good camera  my big thing is that id like to keep costs to a minuimum  minimum  i have read that 5C arent that durable... do y'all have the 5S?  and i guess for giggles, what would i be looking at for the 6?  good info... seems like it is might be worth jsut going to the 6 based on cost to keep up with current systems  thx Emmy... i'm going to sleep on it and prob look to visit a store this weekend.  can i ask what do you use?  i'd hope provider youd say verizon :)  but yes, device  k - great, thx for the chat.  super, thx again... happy hump day!!||@

May I please have your 10 digit mobile number and your full name?  Thanks for verifying that information for me Jeongcheol! We want to make sure your account information remains secure. I see that you just became a customer with us in MAARCH, thanks for your decision to become a part of the VERIZON Family. We really appreciate your business! While I am reviewing the account, May I ask how has your overall service been with VERIZON Wireless?    Great to hear that all has been well. We know the overages can cause concerns and increase the bill. We do have a feature names family base that helps prevent overages and lets you set up usage limits that can not be exceeded once reached! After reviewing the account I see the current bill had a forwarded balance of 167.87 from the July bill that was not paid. However we see the payment was made on 8/4/15 leaving the current bill balance of 113.37.   The bill does have an overage for 2gb on it and the charge was $15 per gigabyte.   The family base would have prevent theses overages going forward saving those $30 off the bill.   we see the payment was made on 8/4/15 leaving the current bill balance of 113.37.  The payment made was the balance for the July bill, the 113.37 is the August bill due by 8/28/15.  That is correct  In the bill cycle from 7/3-8/2, You used 3.936gb from the 2gb allowance. This made an overage for 2gb billed to the account for $30. You can see this online Place your mouse on my billing and usage and click on view bill then on next page click on view or save printable bill for me please in blue. Then go to page 3.  May I ask what is confusing on the bill.   Online you can see the full details of your usage and how the overage occurred  I have not heard from you for a few moments.  Would you like me to keep this chat session open for you?  Let me clear some things up.   The bill dated 7/2/15, had the total of 167.87. This bill was high as you had an overage of $90 for 6gb. The current bill that is dated 8/2/15, with the total of 113.37 has the overage of $30 on it for 2gb. \  The bill summary has 281.24 as this included the July bill as it was paid late on 8/4/15  That is correct!  Your bill cycle ends on the 2nd each month and starts over on the 3rd. As you know we bill a month in advance, when you pay your bill you are paying to have service for the next month. Your due date each month is the 28th, the July bill was late as you paid on 8/4/15. Therefore the current balance due is not late, it is due by 8/28/15  I am glad I could help resolve this for you today! Thank you for the opportunity to service you today and being apart of our Verizon family. May I ask are there any other concerns you had for me today?    Our 4g phones come fully unlocked when purchased.   The phone is not locked I assure you our 4g LTE device come fully unlocked.    You can use a global sim in the phone for international use while in Korea.   Just switch the sim's and you will be good to go!  You are most absolutely welcome! I am glad I could provide a positive experience today! Again my name is Daniel thank you for your business! Chat back in anytime at all if you have further questions.

It's 503)807-0635  Jeongcheol Shin  Yeah It's been OK. But I overused my data a lot so i guess i would be great if you guys have auto block service when some has overused data.  it*  That's so weird  I made a payment on August 6th and I just checked my bank account but it went through fine  I paid 167.87$ on 8?6  8?6  8/6  so 113.37 should be for August right?  In this his month, I didn't overuse the data so it's supposed to be 75$ but  i don't know where 113.37 come from  I did  I guess i need to talk in person  I can go to verizon tomorrow  Thanks though  yeah  I made a payment of 167.87 on August 4, which was for 7/3-8/2. I know I overused the date at that period, so it'ok. But for this month August, I didn't overuse my date so it must be 75$  but it says it's 113.37. Plus, i don't know why if i go to bill summary it's saying the total amount due is 281.24 which is added 167.87$ more which i already made  So you mean the 167.87$ is for 6/2/2015 to 7/2/15 and the 113.37$ is for  7/3/2015 to 8/2/15?  so it means i didn't pay for 113.37 which should've already been paid by 8/2?  Oh.. It got it. Thank you for your help  can i possibly know how much it would cost if i unlock my phone?  I have 400$ deposite  and I've been paying little bit of the device price for 4month so i just wanna know how much money i need to pay more to unlock the phone  Because i go to Korea for a month this Friday so i wanna unlock it to use while I'm in Korea  Oh Ok cool Thanks.

It is my goal to provide you with excellent service today. May I have your name?  In order to get one of those plans you would have to call in tomorrow to get it.  I can give you a run down on the lower costing plans.  Okay 1gb is $30, 3gb is $45 and 6gb is $60.  yes and actually since you are out of contract it will go to $20 even if you stay on the more everything. If you stay on the more everything plan you can upgrade with a 2 year contract if you switch you would have to do the device payment program.  That is correct.  It will and you're welcome, Were there any other concerns I could address for you today?  Thank you for being the most important part of Verizon Wireless.

OK and I also want to add an Ipad that is compatible with Verizon  I currently pay $40 for each of my phones, does that drop to $20 each?  OK so I think my new bill would be $40 for two phones, $45 for 3gb of data and another $10 to add the Ipad for a total monthly payment of $95.  Did I calculate this correctly?  OK, I will log on and make the change tomorrow.  Hopefully, it will be a simple process.  Thank you.  No, that's all.  Thanks.||@

What can I assist you with today?  I would be more than happy to point you in the right direction to have this change made on the account Shane!  Just a moment please as I access the account on this end for you!  I have your account up on this end now! Thanks for your patience in advance as I check into this for you!  And thanks for being a customer since 3/23/15! While I am reviewing over the account on this end for you, how has your overall experience with Verizon been?  That is fantastic! :)  I have reviewed over the account on this end and I am seeing that the due date on the account is 8/18. There is not a late fee added to the account unless the bill is not paid in the full by the 23rd of each month. The last instance of a late fee on the account is the 7/ 23 bill for the payment being made for the 6/23 bill on 8/4 for the remainder of the past due amount  So as long as you make the payments in full before the 23rd there should be no need to change the billing dates on the account. But if there is a need to do so still, you can contact Customer Care at *611 and we can adjust your billing dates accordingly  Ah ok! If you are setting up Auto Pay, then it would need to be before on the 18th or before in order to set that up as the 18th is technically the due date even though we have that grace period between then and the 23rd  So you can contact Customer Care and we can adjust the end date for the cycle to adjust the billing date on the account and you can then set up auto pay for the 20th :)  I am glad that I could go over this with you this evening Shane! Is there anything else I can check into for you today to ensure that you have had exceptional service with Verizon?  Thank you for chatting with me today and being a valued Verizon customer.   You can also find us on Twitter at @VZWSupport.  Please click on the ?End Chat? button to end this chat.      Have a great night!||@I need to change my payment due date to the 20th of each moneth  month  No problem  Great, thanks :)  But when I tried to set up auto pay, it didn't give me the option to pay on the 20th. We had scheduled the last payment, and for some reason it didn't deduct in time. Unfortunately, we didn't realize that until several days later.  ah, ok. Then I'll just leave auto pay off. That's a bummer, though because it would be easier to not have mishaps if I could set that up.  oh, ok.  I'll call them when I get a chance.  Nope, that's it. Thanks for you help. Have a good night.

Of course I would be more than happy to assist you with that today. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?  Nice to meet you. I see that you have been a valued customer since 2006 and we greatly appreciate that. To answer your initial question no. Since you are an existing customer with a 2 year contract the new plans effective midnight tonight will not directly impact you and/or your account.  Yes, that is correct  The new plans would only effect new customers and not existing customers   Honestly, I do! It is one of our top selling devices and the battery life is longer with a bigger viewing size. The colors and display is more so vibrant! It's a great device ;-)  It would be the same but just in smaller payments||@yes.  we have 4 phones in family account.  Brian is eligible for renewal.  we have a 2 yr lease.  does he have to replace his phone today before midnight to get yhe usual discount price?  Bart  I am Amy's dad  Brian Galaxy S4 and is interested in the S6  So in a few weeks can upgrade at the discount instead of full price?  ok thank you. do you recommend the Samsung galaxy s6 to replace his S4.  I have a motorola maxx and love the long battery life before needing to recharge  Ok good to hear. What are your thoughts on the regular S6 compared to the S6 Edge?  Thanks good bye||@

I hope you are having a wonderful evening! How may I be of assistance tonight?  I would be happy to look into that for you tonight. Give me just a moment to pull up your account, please.  I do see that you have been a loyal Verizon customer since 2012! Thank you for your business. I have a loyalty plan offer that would give you the same talk, text, and data packages you have now for $60.00 a month.  At this time we do not have an unlimited data package available.   For the single line loyalty plans, 2GB is the largest data package. We do have MORE Everything loyalty plans that have higher data allowances, but you would be adding in a line access fee. I can run some of the numbers on those for you if you would like.  With the MORE Everything plans, you could do a 4GB package. It would be $50.00 for the plan, plus the $40.00 line access. You would not save money, but you would have double your current data for only $5.00 more than you are paying now.  Yes the discount would still apply, which would save you another $10.00 a month.  That would be $80.00 a month , before taxes and fees.   Your current monthly charges are $85.00, with your insurance. To split the data with your iPad, you would have to open a new line of service for the iPad, and pay the $10.00 line access fee per month.||@ila  sorry i was typing in my name  i'm wondering if i qualify for the loyalty program  i was told i did some time back. i've been with verizon for several years now.  ii've been a little frustrated with the amount i'm paying for current services and was researching other carriers and plans and prices  and realized i'd probably save more going with loyalty rather than staying with current plan and keeping employee discount. thank you.  wonderful !!  but is there anything available for unlimited data?  what about with increased data?  i have 2 gb right now...  ok that'd be great. i'm just paying way too much right now and going over and need a change.  thank you.  could i still do my employee discount of 20% with baylor college of medicine?  since it's not the loyalty plan  so what would be the total?  per month?  and i pay 75 now?  additionally, how much would it be to split this data with my ipad?||@

Oh ok I see and so sorry this has happened today. I do see the credit of $9.98 added on the 12th today. I am seeing if it was actually applied right now.   OK I am showing the credits are here but have not been applied yet. It is a total of $19.96 off the $219.61 bill. So right now you would just need to pay $199.64 and we will take care of the rest for you once it has had time to apply to your current account balance.   I ma not seeing anything in the remarks for that.   sure can I will be right back to see if I find anything.   So the $40 was for what exactly?   and this was over the phone?   OK   Oh ok so you were on the old 15GB plan for $110 and then we switched back to the 15GB for $100. Now when this happened did you call or chat back in to have it changed when the prices change occurred?   So you called back in January to have it changed to the new price ?   No since it was far back and sorry about that to. I do appreciate you staying in there with me.   Ok so you need the credit of $49.20?   Ok I am just going to do this for you this one time since I do see they were supposed to credit you but isn't showing in the remark.  I will be right back.   Ok you are now updated with that credit.   Right now I am showing $190.45.  So $150.45 is what you need to pay and the unbilled credits will take care of the rest.   Correct yes since your current amount is $219.61, minus the $49.20 I gave today makes it  $170.41 and since you are showing a unbilled credit balance of $19.96 it makes it $150.45   OK sounds good I will even remark the account to show this too.   I am very sorry about that too, I am still happy to help with whatever you need today.   I updated the account too.   If the credits do not apply by the time the billing cycle comes around and chat us up and we'll take care of the rest.   around just*   You're very welcome, =)||@I have spent over an hour on the phone with verizon  I'm fed up.  $9.98 credit was to be applied.  it has been applied twice and removed twice.  Now, the family base has been removed completly so I should be credited an additional $4.99  I am beyond tired of sitting on the phone...  and irritated that the verizon my family app won't work  I opened a ticket august 1st  and they closed it out today by just having me remove it all together. Great Customer Service I tell ya!  I just want to pay my bill and am not doing it until my credits are back on the account.  What about the addtl credit of $40 something.  is that still processing for my price plan adjustment that verizon didn't do.  Can you review again...  I sat on the computer with Verizon  I was being billed $110 a month for my data package and it should have only been $110  should have been only 100  The difference when we upgraded in January  to the current period  I was billed $110 for data and should have been $100. They were putting in a credit for the $10 differece a month.  no it was over a little pop up like this.  after my 18% discount the credit was to be for $49.20  From Jan - July  and the lady updated my plan.  No, the price plan change was in January  when we renewed the plan the rep was to change the plan to the $100  Can't you pull up the chat we had?  This is out of control.  Yes, when we upgraded we received the new plan  however, verizon for whatever reason  did not update the plan  No it was recent  can you tell what day that lady changed the plan?  that was the day we discussed it  correct. For the Data plan that they did not change.  I still have the paperwork from when we upgraded and it clearly states we were on $100 a month but if you look at all the bills verizon continued to charge me the $110  Thank god!  so what is the balance I currently owe?  $150.44?  this makes no sense  up above you said my balance was  OK I am showing the credits are here but have not been applied yet. It is a total of $19.96 off the $219.61 bill. So right now you would just need to pay $199.64 and we will take care of the rest for you once it has had time to apply to your current account balance.  and if you added a credit of $49.20  are you sure  thanks goodness!!!!!!! I am going to E-Mail this chat to myself for my records.  Thank you! I can not believe the service I have gotten from Verizon. I have been on the phone since 5:30 CST  Hopefully this works  thanks!||@

Myquestion is can I keep the phone I have and just buy a new sim card when I switch to a verizon prepaid plan??  I just read online that I can activate my device by entering in a serial code #  and also keep my existing phone number  samsung galaxy light  so then why when I am online it tells me I can keep my device?? and all I need to do is enter that code that is on the phone?? I'm perplexed.  if I use my device?? Well of course I use it. Not sure what you're asking?  I don't?use it on your network because I don't have a verizon plan.  When online it says Already have a device??? you can activate here?do they mean if I already bought device from verizon?? Or is that a universal question for all phones??  AHHH?send away  and the link is?.??? I didn't receive it yet.  would that number be called the build #  the device ID #  is different than the build # or is that it  never mind I found it  so now can I turn in my phone to you to get credit towards a new phone  I was wanting the $60 prepaid no annual contract plan.  whats the month to month?a contract?  When I went to a verizon store they said I will get money back for my phone  Amazing how and what salespeople will say to get you to hear what you want to hear?.thanks but no thanks! Have a pleasant evening and thanks for the info.||@

It looks as though I am paying full price for my samsung phone.  We were supposed to have gotten these phones under a promotial deal at the Cameron Park Verizon store.  Please look into this for me as I am a bit confused.  I am good  I did purchase a tablet for my husband however that was on another promotion for $100 on sale, and I purchased two blue tooths, I believe they were around $60 each, however I would have never paid full price for a phone not when they are available every day on promotions.  Which device?  IT looks as though I paid $650 for something and I dont know what it is?  I just looked at the Bill History for the device I'm paying on.  It looks like I'm paying for my white Samsung phone.  No way did we agree to pay $650 for the phone.  It was not explained to us, Holly who worked for the Cameron Park office did not explain this to us.  We were never led to believe that we were payong $650 for a phone thats rediculous  I have never looked into this until my phone bills started to run so high.  Now that I  Oh well, thats too bad, I blame that store personnel, they said one thing and I didnt read the fine print obviously my fault  thank you for your time.||@

Thank you for chatting in today Holley.   Holley do you have an order number?   Oh wow! Allow me a moment to access your account please?  Sure thing!  Holley I am checking into this for you.  Holley I am not seeing the order I understand how important  it is in getting your device as soon as possible. My best recommendation is to going through and re do the order and select the  option to pick up  the order at the store.      That is strange because I clearly see that the line is upgrade eligible. Let me see what else can be done ok?  Ok thank you,it will be just a few moments.  Holley thank you for your patience I am researching into this for you still.  Sure.  Holley what I can do is process the order for you being that it is not showing and it shows that it is eligible on my end and I will express ship it out and I waive the shipping fee, would that be ok with you?       Great! can you confirm your shipping address for me please ?  Thank you and can you confirm the device type that you were wanting to upgrade to?  It is  the Casio correct?   Ok thanks .  No I am not seeing that one, I looking from the chat notes from the message you got    I understand, Allow me a few moments to get this taken care of I will check back in with you as I am doing this or if you have any questions just chat in ok.   Holley the upgrade will be billed to your account.  Awesome!  Holley just to keep you update the  order system is processing little slower than normal.  I think we going to get through it however .  Oh really?  Ok it seems to be moving now, let me get in there .  Hmm I never thought about that, interesting.   Holly the system time out again, If   you like and do not want to wait you can end chat and I promise you I will text you when I am done and get this done tonight for you, Do You want to have insurance coverage on this device  so that I can added one I am able to proceed?   I will text you the order number to your line ending in 1400 if that is ok with you.  I got it! I promise you  I will make this happen for you.   You are  quite welcome!||@Good Afternoon Kimothy, My question is about an order I placed earlier today to upgrade a phone.  I selected the option to pick up in store and before I hit submit it said that once the order was submitted I could pick up in an hour and would receive an email but I haven't received anything yet and I really needed to pick the phone up in the morning at the latest.  no I never got anything.  I wasn't even sure if the order went through because the money hasn't been debited from my account yet but when I log in it tells me that line 864-378-3518 isn't available for upgrade now and this is the line that I upgraded.  so I'm a little confused.  thanks  that's the problem when I go to the upgrade device page it tells me that the line that I am trying to upgrade is no longer eligible for upgrade.  ok thanks.  DADDY B  864-378-3518 Casio G'zOne Ravine?  image   Not applicable for an upgrade    Not applicable for an upgrade  that's' a screen copy of the upgrade screen for that phone.  thanks  that will be fine.  thanks  the shipping address will be Bert Broadwell 1213 Highway 81 South  Calhoun Falls SC 29628  it's the Kyocera dura xv.  I think that was the one that was the most like the one that he already has.  is there an upgraded casio  one?  ok I didn't see any updated casio's so that's why I believe that the Kyocera dura XV will be the closest to it based on durability.  ok thanks.  when you get to the billing information just let me know because I will have to give you my new debit card number because my old one was compromised and the bank had to issue me another one.  and I do want the Kyocera with the camera  ok great that will be fine  that's fine I work in electronic billing so I totally understand  yep and the internet has been very slow all week.  could have something to do with the meteor showers????  that will be fine and no I don't want to add the insurance or any of the other options.  he just needs it to be able to talk and text and occasionally take pictures of the grandkids.  that will be great.  thanks for all of your help.  thanks||@

What number did you have suspended?  Because the phone was never switched with another phone, nor disconnected. The line resumed as of June 24th (06/24/2015)  When you suspend a line without billing, the line will reconnect after 90 days, if no action was taken. Like putting a new device or disconnecting the line.   You can only suspend a line 180 days, and you can only do 90 at a time.   What I can do for you today, is look into suspending that line for you. But what are your plans for this line? Are you thinking about a new phone, or disconnecting it. Cause we can only suspend it one more time, before the line is active once more.   Okay I see, I do see it was disconnected. Sorry about that confusion. One moment please while I look into that for you.   Not a problem, just one moment please while I review your account.   Thank you for your patience, I am still here and working as quick as I can, I will return shortly.   The line -2446 was it on a Device Payment Agreement?  I see, okay. I am reviewing your bill right now. Thank you very much for your patience.   I apologize for the delay, I will back soon with some information.   Thank you, I appreciate that. Right now I am still reviewing your bill, from the service before the disconnect.   Okay so after further review of your account I found out what has happend.  So when you disconnected your line, it was in the middle of our current bill cycle. So you got a month in advance charge. But now that you no longer have this service, on your next bill. You will be given a credit for that charge. It's just because the disconnect was done on demand after your bill cycle, but it will balance back out and reflect on your next bill in September.   They are automatically done by our systems, I don't have to tell it to give you a credit at all. You should be credited the month in advance charge, and the proration of the month it was disconnected.   Verizon does billing in advanced, what those charges are. Is a prorated amount for the month you disconnected, then one month in advanced. But because you your service was disconnected, you will be credited back for it. However, that credit will not reflect until your next bill in September. Does it make sense?||@Dear Cust. Service,  regarding my bill statement for this month, i think about $80.00 dollars over charged. i have a line that i already reported as been stolen and the line was suspended since this year may or june. but verizon still charged me about that number (line) that i do not have it already ~  since i report the phone as stolen, i never connected that number with other phone.  562 292 2446  Could you please give me account credit for over-charged amount ?  we never requested re-sumed service, how can verizon automatically re-put this number ?  can you please give me account credit since 1 never resumed the phone number ?  i already disconnecting the line, and i think verizon can not charge me $80.00 dollar of monthly fee on this number  thank you for your assist  i don't think so. because its not like i made a 2 yrs contract with verizon. i just purchased a number and put this number my own old phone .  So i do not have any contract with verion for this number, this line ~  ok ~ no problems  yahh, the phone was lost and after that,  i never planed to re-put that number on another device.  could you please let me know how much charges that you can give me credit on next month (september) bill cycle ?  so your mean is verizon just not charge monthly service fee on september bill regarding that line what i disconnected ?  ok, thank you for your serivce||@

Thank you for being a valued Verizon customer since 2008. I really appreciate your business!  Please allow me a few moments to locate the address to send back the device.  Thank you for your patience Stephanie. After researching the account it looks like the previous agent was going to help with replacing your device with a certified like new option. I do not have the capabilities to place an order for that. What I can do is provide the phone number to our tech support team. They are the only ones capable of placing the order and giving you the information to send the device back.  I have not heard from you for a few moments.  Would you like me to keep this chat session open for you?  I really apologize for the inconvenience. I do not have a way to transfer in the chat system. The only department that has the capability to order a certified like new replacement is the Tech Support department.  It is a phone that has gone through a 100+ point inspection to be certified. They usually are devices that have been returned unopened but can no longer be classified as new.  I have not heard from you for a few moments.  Would you like me to keep this chat session open for you?  The number is 1-800-922-0204 you will want to select the help with my device option and it will get you over to Tech Support. You also from your My Verizon account can select your device and then it will give you an option to chat specifically with a tech support team member.  You are most welcome. I wish I could do more. If I had the option to order the replacement I most definitely would for you. I hope you have a wonderful night. Is there anything else I can assist with?||@I was just on a chat with Allison but my chat expired. But she told me that I can get the same phone I have for free but I have to send my old one back with in 5 days. I would like to do that but I didn't have a chance to make sure the shipping address was right.  Stephanie Fetsch  So can you transfer me to the other agent?  I really don't have time to spend a long time on a chat and then do it all over agin on the phone .  I will just have to explain everything again.  If it is going to be a certified like new is that another word for a used phone?  What is the number for Tech Spport?  thank you||@

How may I help you today?   That is a wonderful question! Are you an account manager?   I understand. Are you logged onto his My Verizon account?   Wonderful! You should receive the discount then. Have you already added your phone to your cart?   You would not need a promo code. Are you trying to get the discount on the actual phone or the services?   The equipment would be accessories. The discount would not go towards the actual phone.   Absolutely! The discount would go towards the monthly bill.   It would not show when you check out, but it would automatically be taken off.   Absolutely! If when you get your bill in, you do not see the discount, all you have to do is call Customer Service and have it fixed.   You are very welcome! I would be happy to stay with you while you finish your order.   You are very welcome! Take your time. I will check back with you every so often to make sure you are doing okay.   Just to clarify, did he set up the discounts today or previously?   Then, yes after you place the order I would give them a call and find out why your father has not been receiving the discounts.   You are very welcome! Have you added your phone to your cart?   Fantastic! Can you tell me what page you are on?   Wonderful! Please let me know when you get your confirmation number so I can enter it into our system.   Wonderful! Thank you for that information. It looks like it went through perfectly. Congratulations on your order. If you will now call Customer Service, we can get your discounts active. 19972098647  You would just need verification from your father to have them look at his account.   You are very welcome! Thank you for chatting with Verizon Wireless Sales Chat. Have an outstanding day!||@Hi my name is Laura.  I'm trying to add an additional phone to my account and everything is going well, but my dad has a discount through his company.  How do I make sure the discount is applied when I order the new phone?  Hmmm, no.  Just an employee's daughter.  Yes.  He helped me link to the company login through their intranet.  The company name came up when I went to that link.  Yes, but it doesn't show a discount.  Do I enter a PROMO Code?  Well the flyer said 18% on eligible monthly plans and 25% on equipment.  Okay, that makes sense.  What about the monthly plan fees, would those be eligible if I chose the ""More Everything Plan?""  Cool, how does that happen?  On the paper bill?  Will that show when I check out?  Hmmm...it's not showing on my current paper bill (looking online).   Will I be able to work with a representative if this doesn't show up on the bill.  (Since it doesn't show on check out,  I have to go on faith).  Okay, thanks for your help. :)  Okay, thanks...hang on.  Do you think customer service and get the discount I should have been receiving?   My dad has had this plan with verizon for a long time.  Previously.  Okay, cool.  Thanks so much.  Yes, I'm checking out now.  Checkout, just after putting in credit card information.  Device set up.  Okay, here it is.  2130194218  Okay, thank you.

On behalf of Verizon Wireless, we would like to say Thank You!  As the Customer do you think that there is anything at all I can additionally help with or do you have any suggestions on how we can improve Tom? We greatly appreciate any feedback!   Well, if I made it it may look worse. But we are looking into making it much more user friendly for our customers like you Tom! Sorry for any hassles though.  But I do have your bill breakdown for you too.  Your 2GB plan is $32.40 a month with your 19% discount. Each line is $25 a month with the $15 discount. Your Motorola Droid is $16.66 a month until paid off. The Droid Mini is $14.58 until paid off.   This is $113.64. before taxes.  Taxes are around $10 for you. Or $5 for each line.  You are very welcome Tom! But I will also notate the account for you to be contacted regarding any upcoming promotions for your account. Is this fine?  I?m really sorry to hear you are looking to cancel your service. We certainly value you as a customer. Is there something about your current service that you are not happy with?   Was it only the price? This is the lowest your plan can be unless you lower your data plan.  Would you like to lower your data plan?  Stop scaring me Tom!! And Okie Dokie.

I would be happy to tell you about our plans today! May I ask who I am chatting with?   Hello, Umer! It is nice to meet you. We have some great plans available today to choose from. Can you tell me how much data you will need each month?   Fantastic! Do you know which phone you want to get today?  Super! If you get the LG G3 on a contract today you would only pay $80 per month and the price of the phone today. How does that sound?   Yes, that would be it.   It would be $0.99 today plus sales taxes after that the services would be $80 per month.   You would get 2GB of data.   You are very welcome! Have you added the LG G3 to your cart yet?   Wonderful! I would be more than happy to help you get the phone today. May I ask what your hesitation is?  Yes, the charge is for the data plan plus the monthly line access fee of $40.  I understand. However, we do offer the nation's largest 4G LTE service and are voted the number 1 in customer service.||@hi  can you tell me the very basic plans you offer?  yes my name is umer  :)  like 2 gb with unlimited calls and text  lg g3  is it the 2 yrs contract that you are talking about?  i heard that phone is like 0.99$ a month if you go for 2 yrs contract plus you have to pay 50$ for the services  how much data i will get in 80$  ?  ok thankx fawn  not yet but sure ill think about it  its kinda expensive  like its 2gb and you are charging 80$ for it  cricket charges 50$ per month and gives 2.5 gb  thats good. well thankx for the help||@

May I ask who I have the pleasure of speaking with?  Thanks Jennifer. I do understand your concern regarding this matter and I assure you it is my goal to assist you today the best way I can. Please allow me a few moments to pull up your account information.  Your welcome  Thanks for waiting Jennifer. Previously you were on a 3GB plan and with your line being out of contract then you would qualify for a $15.00 discount but with a plan with 6GB or more then you would qualify for $25.00 off. It would be cheaper for you to be on a 6GB plan that way you get the better discount with more data. The reason why this bill is a little higher is because the month in advance charge for the plan change. Also, and I do apologize but the previous rep did not put the discount on your line which is also why your bill is higher. What I can do for you though is put the discount on here for you and credit your account for $25.00 since it was not taken off of this current bill.  Yes I can. Please allow me a few moments to make this credit for you and to gather some information.   No problem!  :)  Thanks for holding. Your new monthly bill will be $205.00. I have finished the credit and your new balance is now $220.84.  Your welcome.

I hope you have a great rest of your day! Please select the END CHAT button.||@I am just looking at my phone bill.  I called a few weeks ago and upgraded my plan to 6 GB.  The representative I talked with said that it would be cheaper because one of my phones is no longer under contract.  My bill is more than it typically is.  Would you mind checking it for me?

How may I assist you?  I would be happy to answer any bill questions you have! With whom do I have the pleasure of chatting with today?  Hello, David! Can I please have you verify the last 4 of the social on the account?  Thank you for that, David! What questions do you have for me today?  Sure, go ahead.  Yes, I do see that charge here on your bill. Roaming charges are charged to the bill when you are outside of Verizon coverage or coverage by companies that provide coverage to our subscribers. Have you traveled recently?  Canada sounds cool! That must have been a nice trip! Though you made no calls in Canada, it is still possible to incur roaming charges while just texting. As long as you are using cell towers other than Verizon or their partners cell towers, you are at risk of incurring these charges.   With the More Everything plans texting to Canada while in the US is free, but texting from Canada would incur those charges. Since you've been a loyal Verizon customer since 2003, I would be more than happy to credit those charges back to you. If that's ok with you David?  I'm sorry that you weren't given the correct information before your trip, David.   That's a great question, David. I'm not too sure why this would happen on one line. The $7.92 would reflect the total for the duration of the trip on that line though.   I've just completed adding that credit to your account, David. It has truly been my pleasure to assist you today. In the future, we have many international plan options, even for short trips! Was there anything else I could help with today?  My pleasure, David!

Welcome to Verizon Wireless sales chat!  I want you to have an outstanding experience today. Who do I have the pleasure of chatting with today?  Happy Wednesday!  Welcome to our online Sales Department!  How may I assist you with your order today Daryl?  Conversation transferred due to agent disconnect  Hello! Thank you for contacting Verizon Wireless Sales Chat. I am here to provide you with outstanding service. Who do I have the pleasure of chatting with today?   It's nice to meet you, Daryl! How can I help you today?   I would be more than happy to assist you with upgrading your phone!   Absolutely! All you have to do is add the device to the cart at full price.  Yes that is correct.  Which plan do you currently have?  Well we have a basic phone plan that allows unlimited texting,and 700MINS for $5.  No not at all.  Yes that is correct! Does that sound like something you are interested in?   Absolutely! I'll be here every step of the wauy.  Of course! It'll be my pleasure!  The LG terra and the LG Revere 3 are some good texting basic phones.  Excellent!  Yes that is correct.  I completely understand =)  I know the Extravert 2 does.  Well I'm here to assure the order goes through on our end but to give my advice the LG Extravert is good if you like the slide out keyboard with a touch screen also.  You have 14 days to return it.  No problem, it is my pleasure!  Take your time Daryl!  I'll be here.  Please allow me one moment to research that information for you.   It doesn't come with data and with the phone and the plan it's around $25 a month.  Awesome! Well just add the device at full price to the cart and proceed.  Awesome!  How is everything going?  It's okay I completely understand.  Great! That's Fantastic!   What plans is it showing?  Press continue to see what comes up.  Okay do you see an option to go to MORE Everything plan on the screen?  You will click that.  Awesome!  Why is this?  Try proceeding to the cart to see the charges.  The line access fee of the device is $30. That will be $20 on the bill, I don't know why it is showing $30 here.  Well there is a line access fee to be able to use the device and I did state that it would be around $25 with the phone and the plan.  It;s okay I completely understand however since you are buying at full price, the line access fee will go down since it is not in contract.  Yes this is the line access fee right now. But since you are getting it at full price. You can call customer service to inform them that it  is at full price and the line access fee will go down.  you may be paying $20 a month just to estimate.  I completely understand. You can go ahead and place the order to reserve the device, and once you call in the morning to get it straightened out you have the option to cancel right there on the phone.  I totally understand.out1   Is there anything else I can do to ensure that your chat experience is outstanding?   You are very welcome! Thank you for chatting with Verizon Wireless Sales Chat. Have an outstanding day!||@Daryl  I'd like to upgrade my phone, pay for it in full and not change my plan.  Is that possible?  Still there?  Daryl  I'd like to upgrade my phone, pay for it in full, not change my plan or sign another agreement. Is that possible?  OK.  Another question?  I am sure it has to be a ""basic"" phone right?  And can you tell me how much each text would cost me if I used text messaging?  I am allowed 30 mins. right?  30 mins. of talk time!  It's called the ""All in one plan""  It appears Data is pay per use and text messaging is pay per message.  Would that require me to sign a 2 yr. agreement?  Hum?  So 700 mins. and unlimited text for $5.00/month?  I think so.  I just need to decide on a phone.  Can I pick the phone and this plan online?  OK.  Sounds good.  You've got time for me to shop for the phone?  Ok.  So a basic phone.  Any recommendations with texting in mind.  Looking at them now.  Texting is from the numeric keypad on both?  Not sure if that would drive me crazy!  :-)  The LG Cosmos 3 and Extravert 2 appear to have slideout keyboards  I really want to give this more thought.  Can I decide and then elect the  phone and plan on my own without a representative's assistance?  Question?  If I order and receive this phone and decide I don't like it do I have any options?  I really appreciate your time and patience by the way!  OK.  Cool.  Looking at both and trying to decide on one or the other.  Won't take long..........I promise!  :-)  No data, right?  So how much would be cost under the plan we've discussed?  Or is data even available with this plan?  OK.  Thanks.  I think I'd like to proceed with the LG Extravert 2 with the $5.00 plan with 700 mins. plus unlimited text with no new agreement.  Good deal.  I'm good.  I'm sorry.  Was I supposed to place the phone and plan in my cart?  I just re-read your last message.  I was supposed to do that.  Sorry!  OK.  Doing it now.  OK. So I am at the change plan screen.  I don't see the option for the $5.00 plan we discussed.  0.00 per per message sent/received or $10.00 for 1000 messages.  Nothing relating to 700 mins.  I received an error of sorts. It says ""Please make the required data and messaging selection below.""  I do.  Ah haw!  See it  However, it says there is a $35.00 monthly charge!  Not sure!  Ok.  So the cart says $5.00 for the MORE Everything Talk - 700 & unlimited text.  But then there is a $30.00 charge for "" Line Access, 1 feature phone, LG Extravert 2 in blue, plus the $109.00 for the phone.  Sorry for so much trouble.  But I am not paying the line access fee now and don't want to pay it.  I was hoping the $5.00 fee would be the total monthly fee plus taxes.  Guess I didn't catch that.  Sorry.  I sincerely appreciate your time and truly apologize for the time I've taken!  Go down?  Do you have any idea how much it might go down?  OK.  I will want to investigate that first.  I know.......being a real tight wad!  :-)  Thanks, but I'll want to do my research first.  I don't think so.  You've been great and ooooooo so patience.  Thanks so much.||@

My name is Marie. How are you doing today?  I am glad that you are doing good, Melanie. I understand that it is upsetting having an overage on the bill. I understand that you already changed the data allowance plan but wanted to have some adjustments since this should have been changed in the past few months, right?  Thank you for the information, Melanie. I will be reviewing your account to check options to help you.  :) It is my pleasure.  Thank you for your time, Melanie, I see that currently you have an overage on data usage. The plan is still with the 1GB allowance. I see the change is effective on 8/20/2015, which is the next billing cycle. Did you do the change online?  For the current cycle, to avoid another overage, the change should be effective the start of this current cycle.   I see the usage is already 2186.54MB, which is already more than the 2GB allowance, Melanie. You will still be charge for overage even if you change this to 2GB. 2GB is 2048MB  Thank you for letting me know. Melanie, I recommend to change the effective date of the plan change, so you will have 2GB starting this current cycle. Will that work for you?  Great! Doing it now, then I will continue to review the account on the adjustment that you are requesting.  :) you are welcome.  I successfully deleted the previous order, and successfully changed your plan from 1GB to 2G, effective this current cycle.  You are welcome.  I appreciate your time, after I reviewed the account, Melanie, I am able to give you a $15.00 credit towards the bill, to help you with the overage charges that you had.  You are most welcome, Melanie. the credit has been issued now.   With the balance earlier for $96.63, it is now $81.63. You will see in black &#38; white the credit on the next bill, but it is impacting the current balance.  You are most welcome, Melanie.  Do you have other questions or concerns that I can help you with?  Again, my name is Marie. Have a wonderful day! Thank you for chatting with me today and being a valued Verizon customer.

I was having issues with my plan because I had 1 GB of data and have been going over the past 3 or 4 billing cycles and I had called right after the first one to have it changed and it somehow never got changed. I was able to just change it to the 2 GB but was hoping to be credited something because I have been paying over 30 extra dollars a month when it was supposed to be changed a few months ago.  I am good thank you for asking!  Yes. I don't remember the exact day that I had called and spoken to someone but it was right after the first month that I had gone over my data which I believe was probably 4 billing cycles ago.  thank you so much i appreciate it.  Yes I was just in a chat that I was guided to do so. Thank you  I just changed jobs and my current job will have Wifi now so I will be using less data so 2 GB should definitely be fine from now on.
